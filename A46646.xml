            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the booke called Icon-baſilice was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming foorth the Rebells guilt Suggeſted Suſpitions to them of danger from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> as formerly they apprehended from his life, ſtriving, that he might not appeare to poſteritie out of thoſe ignominious Circumſtances, which they had contrived in the murther of him, and thence their rigid Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after perſons and Preſſes. Rebells riſe by flattery, rule by force, and they, that made ſo many appeales to the people, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them now to know the groanes of a dead Martyr. Vpon the comming foorth of the booke; they found what they feared, that many, whoſe paſſion kept them from a right judgment in the heate of Action, ſaw their owne errours in that booke, and that the perſon, and cauſe of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> began to be more Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally vnderſtood, and being not able to ſtrangle it in the birth, they ſought how to caſt itt foorth to be deſtroyed, rayſinge ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, that it was not the worke of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> thinkeing to make men leſſe intent on the booke, if the author were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and that they might thereby take of all opinion of pietie, and wiſedome from his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> which might be collected from his writings, it being the Cuſtome of Rebells to prevaile more by Calumnies vpon the diſpoſition, then the Actions of Princes. They ſeeke to improve crueltie above nature for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by wicked hands deſtroyed the Lords anointed, they would deface the Memory of their owne vile Actions againſt him, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95058:3"/>falſe Prophetts to curſe him, &amp; they grudge at his Crowne in heaven, as they uſurped that on earth. Its no new thing for perſons of moſt eminent vertue to fall into the obloquy, &amp; ſuffer by the rage of the miſled people, and therefore no wonder if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence finde an oratour to accuſe it, &amp; Treaſon an Advocate, to defend it. Rebellion never wanted a Trumpet &amp; though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of it be in Caves, &amp; vaults, yet ſucceſſe makes it outface the light. His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke hath paſſed the cenſure of the greateſt part of the learned world, being tranſlated into the moſt ſpred Languages, and ſtrangers honour his Memory, and abhorre his murtherers, but ſuch, as regarde not the al ſeeing eye of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding their wickednes, deſpiſe the judgment of the whole world, and there is a man found out, that will breake downe the united reaſon of mankinde, &amp; he tells men, they muſt take his word above their owne, and all mens reaſon, this he vndertakes, that lookes on kings, as Ants, and the kings booke, as wanting all moment of Soliditie, and if, as he choſe the Title of Iconocla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes he had written his booke in a Forraigne, or learned language, his vnfaith fullnes, and impudence would be as open, and odious as his vanitie is ridiculous.</p>
            <p>And though the exceptions againſt his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke fall away of them ſelves, and Traytours Apologies carry with them their owne Confutation, yet indignation at the ſhameleſſe inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and vntruth of Iconoclaſtes provokes a juſt vindication of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> from the lewde ſlanders of the anſwearer. A Dumbe childe gott ſpeech at the apprehenſion of an Injury to the father, and its a dead Loyaltie, that ſtands vnmoved at the curſing of a ſhimei, and thoſe curſes of ſhimei recorded in Scripture were leſſe virulent, and more excuſable, then this Authors language of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> through his whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, which is a Treaſon againſt God, and Man, Religion, Truth, and Iuſtice.</p>

               <hi>THE</hi> Preface Examined.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>IS Firſt words are. <hi>To deſcant on the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of a perſon fallen from ſo high a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gintie, who hath alſo paid his finall debt to nature, and his faults, is neither of it ſelfe a thing commendable, nor the intention of this Diſcourſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it is not a thing commendable is a greed by all, and that it is the intention of this Authors Diſcourſe all men diſcerne by this very expreſſion, and in every Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod he inſolently, and ſcorne fully ſpeakes of the perſon of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> as fallen into that misfortune, and his whole booke is a continued Confutation of this falſe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. baſe natures delight in the misfortunes of perſons in higheſt place: It is hatefull in any to deſcant on the misfortunes, of Princes, but in ſuch, as have relation vnto them by ſervice, or Subiection as this libeller to the late king is the Compendium of all vnworthynes, and vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inſolence. Could he ſay <hi>his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> had paid his debt to his faults without deſcant on his misfortunes?</hi> But he giues timely warning, what is to be expected in his booke,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95058:4"/>where like a shameles theife taken in the fact he denies what he openly acts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſaies it is not to get a name, for no man ever got ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by writing againſt a King, being ſtrong in Legions, weake in Arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some men have deſired a name for Brutish arrogance againſt Princes, and that may be the Authors ambition, but however it have fared with others, that have ſpitt their venom in the faces of Kings, its certaine he hath lighted vpon the prediction of his owne ſucceſſe, for he will gaine only in famy by this vndertaking. Never man found honour by raking in the ashes of dead Princes, but vnnatural crueltie ſeekes to Surfeit vpon the grave. This Author doth not only digg vp the bones of the dead King, but ſeekes to bring Deſtruction on al Kings, and bury them in the ruines of their Authoritie. depraved natures account the greateſt wickednes the greateſt glory, &amp; more honour to ſubvert humane Societie, then deſtroy a Single perſon.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſtep, where by he mounts to Triumph over his ſacred <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> is for that he was a King, and that is vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as proofe Sufficient, that he was <hi>weake at Arguments, Kings</hi> (he ſaies) <hi>being accuſtomed from the Cradle to vſe their will only, as their right hand, their Reaſon alwayes, as their left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soe deſperate is the wickednes of theſe men, that muſt vilifie the Ordinances of God for their defence. Had they matter of juſt exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not, they would not draw matter of Reproach from his Office, and had they any feare of God, or reverence to man, they would not thus Lewdly traduce this greate Inſtitution of God for the governing of mankinde the Kingly Office. God him ſelfe ſaies <hi>the Kings heart is in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95058:4"/>hand of the Lord, and he turneth it as Rivers of water. That a wiſe Sentence is in the heart of the King,</hi> and yet this man pretends to expect beleife in his Calumnies vpon the late King, when hee affirmes the kingly Office to bee a cauſe of weakenes of judgment, and inſufficiencie, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the promiſes of God in Scripture for aſſiſtance of Kings with his ſpiritt to meere Compliment, and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly belying the many Monarchs of the world, that have beene as farr above others in Wiſedome, as they have beene in power.</p>
            <p>Wee have lived to ſee that ſore evill, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the pen of a King, and the wiſeſt of men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, <hi>to ſee Princes on foote, &amp; Servants on horſebacke,</hi> when the Licentious inſolence of the meaneſt tramples vpon the Soveraigntie of the higheſt, and the baſeſt of the people revile their King.</p>
            <p>He ſaies <hi>for their ſakes, that have not more Seriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered Kings, then in the gawdy name of Majeſtie, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, &amp; their doings, as if they breathed not the ſame breath with other men he will</hi> (<hi>for it ſeemes,</hi> he ſaies, <hi>a Challenge both of him, and his partie</hi>) <hi>take vp the gantlet (though a Kings) in the behalfe of libertie, and the common wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Loyaltie hath no friends, that ſo admire Princes, as if they breathed not common breath of nature, they wel know who hath ſaid of Kings, <hi>I have ſaid you are Gods</hi> &amp; the guilt of their ſin, that diſobey, or revile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet non are ignorant, that <hi>their breath is in their noſthrils, &amp; that they ſhall dye, as others.</hi> They, that are beſt inſtructed, &amp; moſt conſiderate give moſt reverence to Kings. They vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that Princes have greater promiſes of wiſedome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, &amp; greater meanes to attaine it then others, &amp; that by obeying them humane ſocietie is maintained, though
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95058:5"/>they breath the ſame breath with them. When Saul was made King of Iſrael, there were wicked men, that ſaid, <hi>how ſhall this man ſave us,</hi> contemning his Authoritie, becauſe he was taken from among them ſelves, &amp; in our dayes there is a Confluence of all the Rebellious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that troubled the world, pride of baſe people, and diſdaine of all Authoritie. Becauſe Kings are men, muſt they not therefore Rule? Muſt Gods vicegerents be deſpyſed, becauſe they are men? And becauſe we know Kings to be men, muſt wee beleive, that ſeditious ſlanderers are more then men, which are carryed, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall brute Beaſts? The Archangell diſputing with the Devill durſt not bring againſt him a rayling accuſation, and ſuch, as take vp Rayling accuſations againſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces partake of the wickednes of the evill, and hate the holynes of the bleſſed Angell. When the woman told David, he was as an Angell of God, did shee thinke he breathed not the ſame breath with others? This Author by pretending to rectifie an errour, that never was of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring kings, as if they breathed not the common breath of men would perſwade men to ſcorne, &amp; deſpiſe kings, and Rebell againſt the king of kings God himſelfe, who wilbe called king, and to ſtyle that Title <hi>a gaudy name</hi> expreſſeth rather a ſcoffing Atheiſt, then a profeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Ambitious Rebells, that ſow the ſeedes of diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to their king among the people, begin with a plauſible trueth, that kings are men, that they may erre, that they may be wicked, thence they come to applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of particular Actions of their king, repreſented as deceitefully, as falshood can frame to the vnwary hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, &amp; becauſe it may be ſo, therefore in their logicke it muſt be ſo, and experience it ſelfe hath made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95058:5"/>how few, or none admire Kings, as if they breathed not the common breath of men, and how many forgett their dutie to them, that in Scripture are called Gods. the prevalence of corrupt nature is ſo farr above reaſon, that men are ſooner infatuated by the plauſible diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ambitious aſpirers to beleive abſurdities making way for Rebellion, then mistaken of the nature of Kings by their ſacred Title, or dignitie, for wee have ſeene men ſeduced to beleive they might make warr againſt the King, ſo as they ſaid it was aganiſt his evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours, and for King, and Parliament, that becauſe the two houſes ſate by the Kings authoritie, therefore him ſelfe had none. That they made warr in their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the King, and yet ſaid they fought for King, and Parlament, and contrary to the knowledge of the whole world traduced his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Government, which was the time, if ever, when his three Kingdomes attained the height of honour, ſtrength, and wealth above their neighbours. As the Arts of thoſe ſeedes-men of ſathan were jnſpired by their Maſter to the ruine of mankinde: ſo how farr they have effected it in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſt: three kingdomes by this logicke of the Devill all men are wittneſſes. All boundaries of right, and wrong broken downe, and any wickednes acted by authoritie, that ſerves to ſecure the Tyranicall power, &amp; will of the Rebell Maſters. What flouds of Chriſtian blood, what ſtarving, &amp; pininge to death of poore Captives have our dayes been wittnes of in England? what jmpudent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of juſtice for publique Murthers, ſcenes of Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and theaters of ſlaughter? honour, and vertue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to the Common Executioner, ſo as the miſeries of former times were but an Epitome of thoſe numerous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95058:6"/>evills, that have been brought vpon his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Dominions in theſe few yeares, &amp; the facts would ſeeme incredible in after ages, did not ſuch, as this Author undauntedly boaſt of the inſolencies they have committed, no hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie yeilding on example of the like, whether we reguard the impudence, crueltie, inſolence, and hipocriſie of the contrivers, deceite impoſture &amp; profannes of preachers, or credulitie, and precipitation, of the vulgar.</p>
            <p>The author might have done well to ſhew, why his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke ſeemed a Challenge, it provokes no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare, nor handles any thing by way of controverſie but his very devotions, and inſtructions to his ſon ſeeme a Challenge, Evidence of worth in the ſufferer torments the perſecutour, and they cannot reſt, while the vertues live, though the bodies are laid in the duſt by their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he wil take vp the gantlet</hi> (that no man threw downe) <hi>though a Kings.</hi> He lately ſaid <hi>Kings were puny Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, and no honour to begotten by writing againſt them</hi> and now he will take vp the gantlet, though a Kings; it ſeemes he reckons it a condescention to ſtoope to take vp a Kings gantlet, thoſe todes, that thus ſwell wil breake with their owne venom.</p>
            <p>This Authors pen ſhewes what libertie he loves, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, no juſtice towards the living, or Charitie to the dead, and to breake thoſe fetters of modeſtie, and truth, wherein a Chriſtians libertie conſiſts. Thoſe peſts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment allwayes talke of libertie, but its only a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to exerciſe their own inperious Tyrany over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and when fire breakes out of the bramble to conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the Cedars, nothing can be expected, but inſolence, and crueltie wee have ſeene the libertie vnder the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95058:6"/>in England, which is to rayle, and Rebell againſt the King, and deſtroy ſuch, as are loyall.</p>
            <p>He ſaies <hi>its the drift of a factious, and defeated partie to make the ſame advantage of his booke, as before of his name, &amp; authoritie and intend not ſo much the defence of his former Actions, as promoting future deſignes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe, whome he calls a <hi>defeated partie</hi> in ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt are never the neerer a faction for the ſucceſſe, that confeſſed Rebells have gained over them. Though Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes have been defeated, a good cauſe can never, and though he would have his Trayterous faction beleive them, that followed the king a defeated partie yet it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes by his jealoſie him ſelfe doth not. Tyrants cannot ſleepe, while lawfull heires ſurvive, and the guilt of their conſciences, and vſurped power make their Enemies as terrible after they have loſt Armyes, as before. When Rebells prevaile they declaime againſt Treaſon, and in contempt of God, and their conſciences reproach ſuch with their Crymes, that moſt oppoſe them in their firſt Actions, they made vſe of the <hi>Kings name, and authoritie,</hi> their declarations cannot be retracted, wherein they profeſt to be for <hi>King and Parliament,</hi> that they fought not againſt the king, but his evil councell. The Cryme of fighting againſt the king, was a Treaſon ſo knowne, that ſhame, as well, as feare would have leſſened their partie, had they not made vſe of the kings name, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his authoritie, and vnles they thinke, that their aſſertions of apparent vntruths will have the ſame power over the reaſons of men, as their Armes have gotten over their perſons they would not patch vp diſcourſes with ſuch incongruities, objecting, that the kings partie vſed his name, and authoritie, which vndoudtedly they had,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95058:7"/>and which thoſe men profeſſe to deſtroy, and which had been vſeles to any, had it not been the acknowledged power of the kingdome, and a confeſſed Cryme to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, and which thoſe Traytours would never have pretended, had not the evidence of its right been ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, nor have deſtroyed after ſo much vſe of it, had they not exceeded all former Traytours, as farr, as he did his Predeceſſours, of whom the ſpirit of God ſaies, <hi>there was none like him, that ſold himſelfe to worke wickednes.</hi> Its the drift of the Rebell partie to confirme, and continue their power by the ſame Arts they have gained it, &amp; deny juſtice to the memory of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> as before obedience to his Government. Thoſe whoſe power hath been gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the peoples credulitie would willingly deprive them of reaſon, whereby they might ſee their errour, which is the cauſe, that the Rebells having miſted many into the preſent miſcheyfe by Calumnies of inſufficiencie in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> and diſaffection to the eſtablished Religion, account any proofe publiſhed to the contrary the plot of a faction againſt their Rebell Common-wealth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their often acceſſes to him, and debates with him during his reſtraint, and the obſervation of his devotion gave ſuch proofe of both, as diverſe of their followers were vndeceived both in him, and the cauſe they had proſecuted, yet this they would have an effect of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; any relation of his Maj: afflictions a deſigne. His Maj: actions neede no defence, the Rebells impious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt him are incapable of any, &amp; this Author hath ſome reaſon to coniecture, that all mention of the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of his late Maj: tends to the ruine of the Rebell po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. True narrations of the horrid Actions of Traytours, though they recount the greatenes, &amp; glory of theyr tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95058:7"/>ſting them with an expectation of vengeance, &amp; deſtruction of their power. There are a great number, that ſince they have ſeene that booke thinke it had been agreat loſſe to the world, if it had periſhed, &amp; yet they are farr from deſigne by it, and if it were publiſhed with any deſigne, it was an innocent one to publiſh what a murthered King, had left written of himſelfe for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Actions, and cleering of miſtakes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The deſigne is now the third time to corrupt the people to the dishonour of the preſent Government, &amp; retarde a generall peace ſo needeful to this afflicted nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They cannot ſay any were corrupted, that followed their King; vnles the lawes, their legall oaths, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe corrupted them, for theis were the guides they followed, and the Rebells may reſt aſſured, that if there were not theſe bonds vpon the loyall Engliſh, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Treatiſes, though never ſo excellent would little move them to the loſſe of life, and fortunes.</p>
            <p>For the diſhonour of that, which he calls the preſent Government themſelves have written enough, though the King, and his partie were ſilent. Their power was gotten by often repeated propoſitions, &amp; proteſtations, of affection, and loyaltie to his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> which they never meant to performe, many falſe pretences to the people to defend the King, and eſtabilſhed lawes, and Religion, breach of oaths, murther of the King, and of theis nothing can be denyed by themſelves, and there is nothing can be ſaid of any to dishonour beyound ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and fore ſwearing, Treaſon, and Murther. And can they thinke their peace is retarded by the Kings, partie, when themſelves have ſo often ſworne by the name af God in hipocriſie to deceive, made Religion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95058:8"/>the Maſke of ſacriledge, and murther, and pretend pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the afflicted nation, while they afflict it &amp; continue the ſame wickednes, where by they brought the miſerie vpon it? They may be ſure, though they deſtroy the King, and his partie, God will raiſe them Enemies they thinke not of, and prepare deſtroyers they feare not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Its a Good deede</hi> (he ſajes) <hi>to the living by remembring men of the truth of what they know to he miſaffirmed to keepe them from entring into warr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is wickednes to oppoſe truth, and offer that to be beleived by men which they know to be falſe. If this Author would remember men only of <hi>truth,</hi> he would finde no adverſary, and if his partie would act according<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, there would be no neede of <hi>a new warr,</hi> for then they would reſtore King, and lawes, but this Author by falſifying of Actions, att corrupting of principles endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to draw men into a ſtate of Rebellion againſt God, and their King, and make the warr endles, &amp; the people helpeles, and his pretended Charitie is more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then the Hipocrites Almes, this reſpecting only ſelfe glory, that of this Author a ſnare to deſtroy others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to moment of ſoliditie</hi> (he ſayes) <hi>in the booke it ſelfe ſtuft with nought els, but the Common grounds of Tyranny, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, ſuguered a little over, or any neede of anſwearing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſtayed, and well principled men, I take it on me, as a worke aſſigned rather then by me choſen, or affected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He would have it thought there was no moment of ſoliditie, becauſe he hath none in this Iconoclaſtes ſtuft full of the common grounds of Rebellion, &amp; confuſion, which are only of Moment to the ſupport of vſurpation, the meaſure of his <hi>well principeld men</hi> to whome a rayling libell is more convincing, then a Logicall Argument.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95058:8"/>That the booke is <hi>ſtuft</hi> with nought els, <hi>but grounds of Tyrany, and Popery,</hi> when the moſt part of his exceptions comprehended not thoſe heads is an Hiperbole vnbefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any, but ſuch, as had ſacrificed ſhame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to a wicked cauſe.</p>
            <p>If the publiſhing of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke as (he ſajes) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning nothing but <hi>grounds of Tyrany, and Popery</hi> were a deſigne of his partie, ſurely it muſt concurre with the Authors ends, for the cheife Calumnies, whereby the Rebells ſought to draw the peoples affections from his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> were, that he would introduce <hi>Tyrany, and Popery</hi> and the publiſhing of ſuch a booke in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> name was moſt effectuall to make good, what was obiected. And the man, that thinkes the Kings partie ſo voyde of ſenſe, may thinke them <hi>well principeld men,</hi> that ſwallow ſuch crudities, as he hath provided for them, and they may be excuſed, if they be not moved with his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke, for it cannot be expected they ſhould vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and receive reaſon, and for thoſe doubtles the Author writt his booke, for it could not be hoped, that they, who had any dram of reaſon, and had not reſolved to continue in Rebellious vndertakings againſt all the light of Religion, and reaſon would be fit readers of ſuch incoherent Barbarismes. <hi>Grounds of Tyrany, and Popery</hi> are not ſo ſubtile to escape all the would without the helpe of this authors finger to point att it, and had the booke conteyned any ſuch matter, he would have vſed leſſe rayling, and more reaſon, heate, &amp; fowle language proceede from impotencie of defence, and thence is the greate noyſe of words, and inſignificant matter of Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noclaſtes. Common angers disorder reaſon, but vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall furious distempers deſtroy it. The preſent Traytours
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95058:9"/>att leaſt as many of them, as ſate in the beginning of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Parliament, where this Rebellion was hatcht proteſted before God to defend with their lives, and fortunes the doctrine eſtablished in the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and that muſt conteyne the grounds of Popery, or the author will finde none in that booke, but in the ſence of Traytours: Church is Popery, &amp; King, is Tyrany. If they, that aſſigned this worke on the Author differed not in judgment from him touching <hi>moment of ſoliditie</hi> in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke, they ſhewed a very ſlight eſteeme of a Champion ſo confident of his parts, but they knew his malice, not his <hi>ſoliditie,</hi> And they knew it was in vaine for them to ſeeke to anſweare his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke with <hi>ſoliditie,</hi> falſities, and detractions being all their hopes, and they knew not a man els, whoſe credit they could more eaſily proſtitute, nor any man more greedy of ſo baſe ane imployment.</p>
            <p>He ſajes <hi>if the late King, had thought ſufficient thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweares, and defences made for him in his life time, they who on the other ſide accuſed his il Government, judging enough had been replied, the heate of this controverſie was in likelihood drawing to an end, and the farther mention of his deedes, not ſo much vnfortunate, as faultie had in tendernes of his late ſufferings been willingly forborne, and perhaps for the preſent age have ſlept, while his adverſaries calmed with ſucces had been leſſe vnfavourable to his Memory:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late King, thought thoſe anſweares, and defences made for him in his life time abundantly ſufficient, and ſo did all indifferent men, and it was not any thought of defect in theis, that moved him to write on particular occurrents of moſt moment in the time of his troubles, and as his memory will not ſtand, or fall att the Rebells
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95058:9"/>courteſie, ſo their aſperſions will rather increaſe, then diminiſh it. This Author thinckes, that men are daunted with his Contumelies, and that if the King, had knowne what words he would have written againſt his booke, he would not have adventured vpon ſuch pikes, but as the Kingly Prophet David ſang to his harpe, and wrote his Divine meditations, while his Enemies ſent foorth <hi>their ſharpe Arrowes, bitter words againſt him,</hi> and that of ſo much venom, as he ſajes, <hi>the poyſon of Aſpes was vnder their lipps:</hi> ſo his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> compoſed thoſe his meditations, while his Enemies compaſſed him on every ſide, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to perſecute him with their <hi>Tongues ſet on fire of Hell,</hi> and though his perſon ſuffered by them, his cauſe, and innocencie was above their reach.</p>
            <p>His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> expected the vtmoſt of their malice after death vpon his name, as he had felt it in his life, and it was ſo farr from his deſire, that mention of his deedes ſhould be forborne, eſpecially thoſe his Enemies excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, that his endeavours were cheifely bent to make them manifeſt to the world with all the obiections, and invectives, that had been made againſt them, and time hath tought this Author, and others of his crew, that many have been convinced of the wickednes of theyr Rebellion, by the declarations, and replies they made againſt his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Truth feares nothing, but to be hidden, &amp; his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> needed noe other Advocate, then the cleere diſcoverie of his deedes, that he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate was the greate wrath of God vpon the nation, where ſo many in the middeſt of ſo great bleſſings of peace, and plentie, as they enioyed vnder his Raigne, continued murmuring, and vnthanke full, and it is not the leaſt ſigne of the heavines of his diſpleaſure, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95058:10"/>the people executioners of it, one vpon another, and that they ſhould act ſuch execrable wickednes by words, and Actions againſt that King, who was freeſt from perſonall vices, and publique preſſures of all his Predeceſſors, that had Raigned ſo long, as he had done. The preſent age muſt nedes have a deepe ſenſe of his loſſe, and poſteritie, aſwell, as ſtrangers will wonder, when they reade his ſtory, and finde ſuch groundles ſlanders, and barbarous cruelties acted againſt ſo eminent vertue, and the confidence in obtruding ſuch groſſe abſurdities, for reaſons, as are vſed by this Author and others, wilbe the infamy of the preſent age, when ſuch evident folly, and wickednes finde credit. Can any man be ſo ſtupid to thinke, that ſuch wretches, as boaſt of their deſtroying the innocent, will ceaſe to defame their memory? and that ſuch, as had no mercie on their lives, will have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes of their ſufferings? That they, which ſuborned detractours, and rayſed lewde reports to give colour to their crueltie, would have a tendernes to him they had tormented, and expreſſe no tendernes for their owne villanies? It had been contrary to his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> wiſedome to have expected tendernes to himſelfe, from ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and contrary to the nature of ſuch ſavage beaſts, to have their blood thirſtines ſlakt, or their crueltie <hi>calmed</hi> with any <hi>ſucceſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſince himſelfe hath left this booke, as the beſt Advocate, and interpreter of his Actions, and his friends by publiſhing &amp;c. and almoſt adoring it, ſeeme to place therein the ſtrength of their cauſe, it would argue doubtfullnes, and deficiencie of the other partie, not to meete his reaſon in any field, the force of whoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes they have ſo often mett victoriouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This libell more evidently proves the deficiencie of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95058:10"/>the Rebell partie, then the omiſſion of an anſweare could have argued, and all men ſee, they are not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but convinced by their owne reaſon of the lewdenes of their Actions. It might be exepcted from the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers mention of the eſteeme his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke hath amongſt his friends, that his anſweare ſhould be of equall account with his Maſters, and thereby the world may be informed how their cauſe hath been maintained. They pretend <hi>to meete reaſon in any field,</hi> but are reſolved to contradict it, and the Author will reproach, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe truth, and reaſon, as his Maſters have fought againſt it, and ſince their impietie cannot be denyed, it muſt be avowed. They glory in their victories in the field, as thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves in their booties, and boaſt, <hi>that they can doe miſcheife,</hi> their victories being no other, then the poyſons and kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves of Aſſaſſins, that have deſtroyed Princes, and ſucceſſe is the evidence of their faith, and reaſon.</p>
            <p>He proceedes to ſay, that <hi>he who at the Barr ſtood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting againſt the forme, and manner of his Iudicature, and complained, that he was not heard, neither he, nor his friends ſhall have that cauſe now to finde fault being mett, and debated with in this Monumentall Court of his owne erectinge, and not only heard, but anſweared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſtill he is vnwillingly heard, and they, which tooke his blood without hearing, are loath to heare the cry of it and they endeavoured the ſame courſe with his booke, they had taken with him, to condemne it vnheard, and as this worke was not choſen, nor affected by Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſtes, ſo was not the occaſion acceptable to his Maſters.</p>
            <p>It hath been reported of ſome high way robbers, that they vſe a forme of Judicature vpon the Traveller, when they take him, and condemne him ſolemnely to loſe his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95058:11"/>purſe, and Iconoclaſtes holds it ſtrange, he ſhould ſtand excepting at the forme, and manner of their Judicature. It was the prodigie of inſolence, that Rebells preſumed to bring their King to the Barr, and the Prodigie of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence in this libeller, that imagines an expectation of the Kings ſubmiſſion to a Tribunall of Traytours. But with Traytours, where ſtrength can act, right, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, are ridiculous conſiderations, otherwiſe thoſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that made themſelves Judges without the leaſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of authoritie (the lower howſe being not able to puinſh a wandring Rogue, which the law allowes a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtable) would not ſo preſumptuouſly ſit in Judgment vpon a King, and not only their own but of another Kingdome; and profeſſe wonder, that any ſhould thinke, that they cannot bring any King, to the blocke, that they get into their hands. Who may not defend the ſins of intemperance to ſatisfie luſt, aſwell, as thoſe of crueltie to ſatiſfie ambition, and why might not Ric: 3: defame his mother, and Kill his nephewes to ſecure his Tyrany, aſwell, as theis men reproach, and Kill their King? doe outward ſolemnities legitimate Murthers, and is a profeſt villanie innocent, &amp; a ſecret only Cryminall?</p>
            <p>Though thoſe Murtherers, before whome he ſtood at the Barr excepting, had reſolved, that neither feare of God, nor reverence to their lawfull king, nor impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, that moves ſuch, as the other reſpects doe not, ſhould prevaile with them, yet he promiſes afaire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, though he juſtifies them, and performes it with the ſame falſhood, offring clamorous reproaches and ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les vntruths, inſtead of anſweares, erecting a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him ſelfe, wherein the defence of impietie, and ſcorne of truth have engraven his infamy in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Characters.</p>

               <hi>Which he ſajes to do effectually, if it be neceſſary that to his booke, nothing the more reſpect be had for being his, they of his owne partie, can have no juſt reaſon to exclaime.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly his owne partie had reaſon to expect, that from reſolved Traytours, his booke would have leſſe reſpect for being his, for having ſuffered greater crueltie in his perſon for being a King, could they thinke his booke would have more reſpect for being his? The Rebells themſelves have publiſhed it a rule, that a man borne in Scotland, while the Kingdomes ſtood divided, was not ſubject to their Judicature, and therefore they vrged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Duke Hamilton, that he was naturalized, and yet they ſubjected the King to their will, whome they could not pretend to have had that Ceremony, and by the law of theſe miſcreants, the King muſt be more ſubject to them then any of his ſubjects of that nation, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor might have ſpared the paines to ſeeke a reaſon for his impudent language, for his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> partie know, it was for the intereſt of his Trayterous cauſe, and a neceſſary effect of a Rebellious diſpoſition. The booke of any Author ought to finde reſpect according to its owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and its folly, or injury to ſleight, or reproach it for the Authors ſake, and the like of a perſon for his office ſake, but they, that reproach an office inſtituted by God, or the perſon, that beares that office for the office ſake, will hate a booke for the good, that it conteynes, and the Kings partie will never exclaime for the Authors detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the booke, which they expected from him, but they have juſt reaſon to deteſt his inſolent language, and impious aſſertions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It were too vnreaſonable, that he becauſe dead ſhould have libertie to ſpeake all evill of the Parliament, and they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

            </p>
            <p>Its too vnreaſonable to bely the dead, and to affirme his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> to ſpeake all evill of the Parliament, when he well knowes, that his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ſpeakes nothing of them, but what this breaker confeſſes to be true, and if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſt: had ſpoken evill of a faction in Parliament, its too vnreaſonable for him to cenſure it, who not only ſpeakes evill of a faction in Parliament, but is the Advocate of thoſe, that not only ſpeake evill of them, but have des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed them. What if his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> had ſpoken evill of the Lords houſe, have this Authors Maſters done leſſe, that have taken it away?

And if the King reprehend, or reprove his ſubjects in the capacitie of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or otherwiſe, it is not only vnreaſonable, but damnable for them to cenſure, and reproach him, and moſt deteſtable for every licentious Pamphletter to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, &amp; vilifie him.

And may not the King complaine of their dealing with him, as well, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor with his new Maſters? can Iconoclaſtes reprove the Parliaments vote, that it was Treaſon for the Army to overaw the Parliament, which he doth in being Advocate for the Army againſt them, And is it a Cryme in his

               <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> to repreſent their evill Actions againſt him? The Parliament voted a Treatie with the King, and voted his conceſſions to be a ſufficient ground for peace, the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler taxes that vote for folly, and falſhood. The Army remove that Parliament, and call ſome Creatures of their owne the Parliament, and they togeather take the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King, and murther him notwithſtanding this Treatie, and vote of Parliament. If it were the Parliament, that voted the Treatie, and the conceſſions to be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for peace, they muſt be Traytours by the Parliaments Judgment, that diſſolved them, and placed the name of Parliament vpon others, and this Author muſt ſpeake more evill of them, then his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> doth, or more of his Maſters, and might with farr more reaſon take on him the defence of the Tumults, as afterwards he doth, then the Parliament, for if the Parliament, may be modelled by Tumults, and are no longer a Parliament, then the leaders of the rabble, judge well of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then the King, in ſpeaking any thing againſt the Parliament, doth no more, then this Author confeſſeth the Tumults may doe, and himſelfe too. He might have claimed a priviledge to ſpeake for the dead, aſwell, as write againſt the King, being dead, for his Maſters murthered it, with the King, and its like he hath leave from his new Maſters to name it yet, for it will not ſtand well heereafter with their Goverment to name a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which may continue the memory of King, and Lords, and the new Repreſentatives will, when the Maſters are ready for it, make the name of Parliament, like an old Almanacke, and the Author wilbe forbidden to name it, as reaſon now forbidds the defence of their Actions againſt his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr>

            <p>In laying the ground worke of this horrid Rebellion, the Maſter worke men ſaw, that people are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht by degrees, and they cannot ſuddenly beleive abſurdities, till their paſſions by Cuſtome be made Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their reaſon, and confirmed in the purſuite of what was propounded to them, vnder pretence of their good. The people then held it a ſin to offer violence to the perſon of their King, They thought they could not cut of the lappe of his garment. They held it odious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his perſon, and the Parliament had ſo often decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that kings, can doe no wrong, and that the law for bidds the ſpeaking of it, that though the wickednes of ſome were enough confirmed to wiſh his deſtruction, they durſt not ſay it, but pretend deſire of Juſtice againſt other perſons, and they reſolved, as Aſſaſſines to ſtabb him, while they kneeled to him, and to betray him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing dutie, and loyaltie, vndermininge his authoritie, with aſperſions on his evill Councellours, as they called them. And as then they laid faults vpon his Councellours,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95058:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>that never acted, ſo now this ſlanderer will make the King guiltie of Actions, that were never done by him, and vnder pretence of not ſparing him in laying the guilt on him, that was properly his, ſeekes to lay all mens faults on him, and is as diſloyall to truth, as Loyaltie.</p>
            <p>To acquit himſelfe his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> needed to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for his adverſaries by their declarations have done it; and they have acquitted his Councellours of theſe very Crymes they objected to them, for this Author wil have the faults they were charged with to be the Kings, and it is in his Language a Ceremonie to accuſe men falſely, &amp; by forged Calumnies to ſeduce the people to the ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their blood, and hazard of their ſoules. This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is the firſt, that ſought to be beleived in an Apologie for falſhood; and to defend the Parliament, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it, ſayes theiſe deceites, and lies were in Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Its certaine the King endeavoured to vndeceive the people, that they might have knowne, that the malice of theſe Traytours was to himſelfe, whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt his evill Councellours, &amp; this Author ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes traynes of Treaſon, framed of knowne vntruths to be only Ceremonies, and rankes the fifth, &amp; ninth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement in the Ceremoniall law, &amp; as many of the reſt, as the breach may be made ſerviceable to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites. If the reproofe of evill ſpeaking againſt Kings in Scripture be a Ceremonie, if dutie, and loyaltie be a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, if veracitie be a Ceremonie, what is morall in this Authors jugdment? Thoſe, whome he calls the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament vſed thoſe impoſtures, vntill they had drawne the people to eſtabliſh thier owne ſlavery, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of thoſe miſcreants over them, and now they laugh at theſe miſerable people, that thus beleived them, as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95058:14"/>they doe at the fineſſe of their fraudes, and deſpiſe the power of God, as they doe his Precepts. It is ſufficiently evident to the world, what promiſes, &amp; profeſſions thoſe the Author calls the Parliament vented to make his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> a glorious King, &amp; beſides their legall oaths, they deviſed new proteſtations of loyaltie, and this the Author calls a Ceremonie to make the world beleive they were loyall to their King, fot the Actions they intended nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſtrong Charmes to delude the people, &amp; make them beleive thoſe men loyall to the King, that rayſed a warr againſt him. The Parliament in one of their declarations told the King, that if they ſhould ſay, that the evill Acts they complained of were done by his Maj: they ſhould ſpeake contrary to the law, and the Teſtimonie of their owne hearts. In another, that they were ready to lay downe their lives, and fortunes, and ſpend the laſt dropp of their blood to maintaine his Crowne, and Royall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in greatenes, and glory, and caſt themſelves downe at his Royall feete. What would he have the world thinke of this ſo ſtoutly acted vehemence only a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie? Certainly one of the moſt pernitious, that ever was practiſed, and an impudent defence ſuites well with a diſcovered falſhood. They profeſſe themſelves Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to ſtage playes, but it is, that they might engroſſe the trade to themſelves, for their Pulpits, aſwell, as Pamphlets ſound principally this repreſentation of paſſion, &amp; ſtage devotion, but it is a ſolleſiſme in ſo greate an actor, as this Author, that ſpeakes alowde, that all is but a Ceremonie, for he thereby gives the world to vnderſtand, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the ſame falſhood in his ſlanders, then the faction in Parliament vſed in their profeſſions of dutie? and loyaltie.</p>

               <hi>This courſe of his in laying the faults on the King he ſayes is, that they, who from the beginning, or but now of late by what vnhappines he knowes not are ſo much infatuated not with his perſon only but with his palpable faults, &amp; dote vpon his defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, may have none to blame, but their owne folly, if they live, and die in ſuch a ſtrok'n blindnes, as next to that of Sodom hath not happened to any ſort of men more groſſe, or more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadinge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee have found many by hellish impulſion hating his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> perſon, and authoritie, and ſeeme not to thinke, that God hath given them vp to a reprobate ſenſe, and ſtrong deluſion, &amp; would be thought to beleive all thoſe, that love, or honour their King infatuated, and thence it is, that the Author knowes not by what vnhappines it is, that men are ſo infatuated, for he would have it beleived a greate happines to hate, and deteſt his King, to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach not only his perſon, but his office Perſecutors endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make them vnhappy, on whome they exerciſe their cruelties, and they wonder at thoſe, that run not with them to the ſame degree of wickednes, &amp; this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes it an vnknowne vnhappines, that men run not from their proteſted, and ſworne Allegiance, and loyaltie into ſo diſperate a Rebellion, as he maintaines, he may well ſay he knowes not by what vnhappines it comes, but it is an vnhappines of greater wonder, that ſoe many ſhould renounce the very names of loyaltie, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, make Rebellion the moſt renowned vertue, and this after ſoe many vowes, and oaths to the contrary, that men, who ſome few yeares ſince profeſſed the greateſt hatred of a Traytour to their King, ſhould now thinke no man ſoe prayſe worthy, nor any blindnes ſoe neere to that miraculous ſtroke of the men of Sodom, as that of the opinion of loyaltie.</p>

            <p>If this Author had intended a right information of men, as he pretends, he would not have played the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in every period, as he hath done in making Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raes, and goblins to affright men. Can he hope, that any reading his booke, will conceive him rightly relating Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or caſes that tells men they are blinde, infatuated with the palpable faults of their Murthered King, and doting vpon his deformities?

            </p>
            <p>Its true, that the vertue, and worth of many injured perſons, hath appeared more evidently after their death, and hath cauſed greife, and repentance in their Enemies moving revenge in thoſe, that were ſeduced to deſtroy them, and the cruelties exerciſed on his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> and his eminent vertues in his ſufferings have manifeſted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many, how vnhappily they were miſlead to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a King, of ſo greate goodnes, and to place their confidence in ſuch falſe, and bloody hipocrites.

            </p>
            <p>The lattine being taken in the right ſenſe, what roome had there been for this curious obſervation? And if they, which ſet foorth his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke had been cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, or ſtupidly negligent, the Author had detracted nothing from his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> It is not the picture but the crueltie exerciſed vpon him, that made him a Martir, and theſe miſcreants are enraged to ſee their owne Actions in picture, which they ſhamed not to commit in the face the world. The picture is farr ſhort of the meaſure of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> pietie, and ſufferings, and wee may expect hard meaſure vpon the booke, when a picture in the front cannot eſcape the Image breaker. This Author its likely wrote from them, that vnderſtood not lattine, that ſeekes to make the front, and lattine in the end ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, when the front hath a picture in the poſture of prayer, and the lattine in the end is applied to the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of prayer. If he had expected to worke on ſuch, as vnderſtood lattine, he would not have obtruded ſuch an inſignificant obſervation of miſconſtrued lattine.

            <p>They that publiſhed his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke are heerein free from that negligent curioſitie, the Author would have ſeene by contriving a ſenſe, which himſelfe will not affirme to be theirs, which vſed the words, but his owne by a libertie of choice, where are different ſenſes to be

            </p>
            <p>The Traytours are loath to ſee the Emblems of their owne inhumane crueltie, and how inſteed of harmeles Pageantry they erected the Theatre, of their Barbarous villanie at white hall. The wickednes of thoſe, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> may be ſhadowed by Emblems, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art, nor wit can fully expreſſe it.

The Authors Pageantry playing with a picture is not the way to vncannoinze a ſaint.

And if we looke vpon the eminencie of the Sufferer, the pride, and crueltie of the perſecutors, the true cauſes on the part of the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or the pretended cauſes of ſuffering on the part of the perſecutors, we ſhall finde few Parallells in Calenders among ſaints to that of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> and its memorable in his ſtory, that his perſecutors their expreſſions ſo much reſemble the curſed Jewes, that crucified our bleſſed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.

And they cannot deny, but what may be done to a King, may be done to any other, ſchiſme and Rebellion are inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Companions, and as this Author defames the Kingly Government, ſo the Church may not eſcape his fury, for rather, then it ſhall have any eſtimation, he will have a long tradition of Idolatry before thoſe good Emperours, but if he had vouchſafed to reade the ſtory, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not vpon his ſpirits, he would have found, that not tradition, but an impious Rebellion ſtirred vp againſt a good Emperour brought the ſuperſtitious Images into the Church, and that the good Emperour with ſtood the bringing in of them, not brake them downe after long Tradition, and thence he might have told vs what kinde of reformation muſt be expected from popular fury, and that as then by Tumultuous violence ſuperſtition was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed, ſo now in England confuſion, and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. This Image breaker thinkes he may aſwell vſurpe an Emperours ſurname, as his Maſters their Kings power, and Eſtate, and while he magnifies the good Emperours corrects himſelfe, leaſt the people thence thinke on their reverence to their King. For he ſayes <hi>the people exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and exceſſive in all their motions are prone oft times not to a Religious only, but to a Civill kinde of Idolatrie in Idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinge their Kings, though never more miſtaken in the object of their worſhipp, heeretofore being wont to repute for ſaints thoſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95058:19"/>faithfull, and coragious Barons, who loſt their lives in the field making glorious warrs againſt Tyrants for the common libertie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never time can better witnes this truth, then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that the people are exorbitant, and exceſſive in all their motions, nor ever man, that put pen to paper could more improperly lay it on their ſcore, then this Author, that takes on him to defend the moſt exorbitant, and exceſſive motions of the people, that any Kingdome hath felt, the power of his. Maſters being founded on thoſe motions, and if the people yet ſee not their errour, they cannot longer be deceived having ſuch a Teſtimonie, as this Author a man without exception in that point, and its likely they begun to ſee, how they were made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their owne ſlavery, that this Author gives ſo ſevere a Character of the people. If they be prone to a Religious Idolatrie, as the Author ſayes they are, they are very vnfit Reformers of the Church, and for that Civill kinde of Idolatrie in Idolizing their Kings, that is in an eminent degree of obedience, for ſuch appeares his meanings, it wil never prove ſin to them, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vice Rebellion is more frequent, and more dangerous to their ſalvation, and many will goe to heaven with this Civill kinde of Idolatrie, when Rebells, and deſpiſers of Dominion wilbe excluded. The Author ſhould have done well to tell, what this Civill kinde of Idolatrie is, if it differs from true, obedience, and whether it may not be given to others, aſwell, as Kings. I beleive if there be ſuch a Civill kinde of Idolatrie, the worſt degree of it is in the reverence borne to King killers, and common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of their Countrey, as the ſtories of all times teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. Rebells never wanted pretentions, but libertie, and Juſtice were the common Maske of ſuch Monſters, ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95058:19"/>this man wil have the world beleive the pretences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, and that Rebellion was allwayes the lawfull ſide, and thence thoſe faithfull, and couragious Barons, that had broken their faith, and Alleagiance to their King, Trayterouſly armed the multitude for private revenge, and ambition muſt be ſainted, &amp; thoſe whome the cleere evidence of law judged Traytours, and their warrs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion muſt be the patrons of common libertie. I thinke the Author will hardly finde a <hi>Calender</hi> of ſuch <hi>ſaints,</hi> if he receive a <hi>Connonization at ſuch a rate,</hi> it will deſerve far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe credit, then the <hi>Gregorian Calender,</hi> but he is not like to finde a <hi>Calender</hi> of ſaints for his purpoſe, vnles it be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſuch faithles Traytours. It hath been ſaid of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, that they love the Treaſon, and hate the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, but theſe new Maſters ſaint the Traytours, &amp; make Treaſon the Canon of their Religion. Some men have pitied men of parts, whoſe paſſions have carried them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vnwarrantable Actions, but never till this age did Chriſtians adore ſuch ſaints. Rebellion is dearer to this Author, then Religion, and he will rather commend ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Actions of a blinde age, and the very dreggs of Popery againſt which he profeſſeth ſo greate Zeale, then want an ingredient to the varniſh of that horrid ſin, and rather then that ſhalbe diſcountenanced, Popery, and Judaiſme it ſelfe ſhalbe admitted. There were a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople, that Idolized Todes, and vipers and all venemous creatures, and theſe men have reſumed that Idolatry, that will have the moſt cruell, and deſtructive impieties to make men ſaints.</p>

            <p>For the firſt of theſe, he was by the Teſtimony of the ſtories of that age the moſt ingrate full Rebell, that any ſtate hath harboured, a man overloaden with his Maſters favours, matcht to his ſiſter, intruſted with his ſecretts, and his forces, yet this man, whome neither benifitts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, nor truſt could oblidge, nor keepe from thruſting the King from his Throne, &amp; aſſuminge the Government to himſelfe for the common libertie, as the Author will have it, is enrolled for <hi>a ſaint.</hi> If there were any ſo <hi>exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, and exceſſive in their motions to ſaint</hi> ſuch a faithleſſe wretch, the Author will hardly finde any ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in his Civill Kinde of Idolatry to their Kings, but whence comes Hen: 3: to be a Tyrant , of whome the ſtories report ſo much mildnes, and hardly ſo greate an errour, as the vnadviſed advancement of that Rebell Montfort? But it is very vſuall with theſe men, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they finde an Example of <hi>Rebellion</hi> there the King is a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and all ſuch Preſidents, as were conveyed to our times to ſhew vs the miſcheife, and wickednes of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> are produced, as authorities for the committing of it, and Garnetts ſtraw wilbe a Miracle, and he a <hi>ſaint,</hi> &amp; the Aſſaſſins of Kings <hi>glorious Champions for common libertie.</hi> For the ſecound, the ſtories are very ſilent of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon libertie pretended by the <hi>Earle of Lancaſter,</hi> or any Tyrany againſt that King, but it matters not what truth there be in an aſſertion ſo a King be made the Criminall, and though the miſtake of ſuch, as held the Earle of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter for ſome time a ſaint, were ridiculous to that very age, yet this Author will have it a leſſe errour, then the keeping of the fifth Commaundement, and the people, that vſed <hi>a Civill Kinde of Idolatry</hi> to their good Emperour, that had the <hi>famous ſurname of Iconoclaſtes more miſtaken in

            <p>Its apparent in the ſtories of our nation, that ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Churchmen had their hands in thoſe <hi>Rebellions</hi> the Author mentions, &amp; therefore might induce the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant rabble to adore the Calves they had ſet vp, &amp; in our dayes wee finde they have ſucceſſours, that teach the people <hi>doctrines of Devills</hi> and ſeduce them from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to thoſe, that had the rule over them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now with a beſotted, and degenerate baſeneſſe of ſpirit, ex, cept ſome few, who yet reteine in them the old Engliſh fortitude, and love of freedome, and have teſtified it by their matchles dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, the reſt embaſtardized from the ancient noblenes of their Anceſtours are ready to fall flat, and give adoration to the Image, and memory of this man, who hath offred at more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fetcher to vndermine our libertie, and put Tyrany into an Act, then any Brittiſh King before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its very ſtrange, that <hi>all except ſome few</hi> are ſo beſotted, as not to love libertie ſo naturall to man, and thoſe, that have ſo contended for it, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation, but if it were poſſible for Iconoclaſtes to deale faithfully, wee might have expected, that he would have told vs, what that libertie was the people loved not, which is the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thoſe ambitious Traytours, that now lord it over them, which are thoſe few he mentions, whoſe match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe villanies have waſted more Engliſh blood in theſe few yeares, then all our Kings in their victorious warrs ſince the conqueſt. The people doubtles love libertie, but they finde themſelves cheated of their juſt libertie vnder a lawfull King, and brought vnder the ſlavery of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95058:21"/>many Tyrants who perſwaded the poore people it was libertie to be without a King, though ſubject to the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious will of vpſtart vſurpers, and why is it degnerate ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenes of ſpirit to vindicate their lawes, &amp; liberties againſt Tyrants, that have vſurped it, and revenge the fraude, &amp; iniury done them by deceivers, that vnder pretence of law, and libertie bereft them of both. The beſt of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells</hi> pretence, which this Author defends is to fight for <hi>libertie,</hi> and if the people finde their libertie taken away, is it vnlawfull to reſume it from Tyrants, and vſurpers, which this Author holds lawfull Kings? Its true men were beſotted with the name of <hi>libertie,</hi> and thoſe Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banques infuſed the principles of <hi>Rebellion</hi> into the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople by telling there could be no libertie vnder <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> as if the nature of Governments were vnknowne till our time, and thence this Author writes, as if none, but beſotted people ſhould reade him. If theſe vipers had profeſſed in the beginninge of their Rebellion, that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Monford, &amp; Thomas Earle of Lancaſter had been ſaints,</hi> and that they intended to follow the Example of ſuch Traytours, the people would not have been ſo beſotted, the miſeries brought on the Kingdome by ſuch ſeducers being ſo largely delivred in ſtory, but the people have now found by ſad experience, that the leaders of the preſent diſorders are the Progenie of thoſe curſed Rebels, whoſe Actions made them odious to all poſteritie, and diſhonoured the times wherein they lived, and this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would brand the whole nation making Rebellion their fortitude, and love of freedome, when its plaine to all readers, that thoſe Rebellions were the ſcourge of the nation, which langiuſhed vnder the burthens, that were encreaſed by thoſe, whome they followed againſt their kings.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:95058:21"/>
            <p>How the people have been <hi>Idolized</hi> by thoſe <hi>Rebells,</hi> Tumults defended, and the power over their king pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the juſtification of this odious Rebellion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the declaration of thoſe they call a Parliament, this Author frequently tells vs in this anſweare, &amp; yet is ſoe careleſſe of truth, or ſhame, as heere their reaſon, and affection are as contemptible, as their right in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſome few muſt raigne over them. The greateſt vnhappines of the Engliſh nation hath been in the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of their kings, &amp; the greateſt diſhonour in the prevalence of inſolent, and ſly Rebells, the noble blood of the moſt renowned perſons being waſted in thoſe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and Civilitie for many yeares deſtroyed. If we place vertue in the inſolent attempts of Rebells againſt lawfull Princes, not only Chriſtian fortitude, but morall vertue grow contemptible, &amp; rage, and venom will ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner get a ſaint-ſhipp, then Juſtice or innocence.</p>
            <p>If <hi>ſo many are ſo ready to fall flat to the Image, and memory of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr>
               </hi> as the Author ſayes, his Maſterts have cauſe to vſe new principles, and as they fought againſt their king by faining a power in the people, ſo they muſt now lay fetters on them, and caſt away the maske a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi> to be vſed no longer.</p>
            <p>It was not a part of our liberties to be deprived of our king, nor to Rebell againſt him, ſuch acts being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions not only to <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but <hi>Engliſh libertie,</hi> and ſuch, as take that libertie to themſelves, robb others of their juſt, &amp; lawfull <hi>liberties.</hi> Doe the preſent, or did ever Traytours give libertie to any, but their faction? And doe they allow them any more, then libertie at the will of the Commaunder? And if libertie be ſo precious to theſe men, why ſhould John lilborne bemore reſtrained,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95058:22"/>then Iconoclaſtes? And why ſhould any be more Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall, that write, or ſpeacke againſt an vſurped power, then they, that wrote againſt the knowne legall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Priſoners in Gayles hire perſons of ſtrong voyces to begg for them att the grate, and the Rebells have found this Authors rancour, and impudence ſo ſublimated, as his falſities, and ſlanders were probable to infest the world, though to knowing, and honeſt men they ſound the voyce of a Beaſt, and not a man; what one libertie of the Engliſh Nation is there now left? Doe not all men ſee, that their ridiculous howſe, and ſtate Councell act at the will of their ſword Maſter, whoſe act thoſe Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers are diſpoſed of to ſignifie what he pleaſeth? Doe not all men ſee, that the vſe of the name libertie ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth nothing, but a ſound to fill the peoples eares, and deceive their vnderſtandinge?</p>
            <p>That Tyranny ſhould be objected to the beſt King, in whoſe time fewer men ſuffred death, then in any time of like extent throughout all our Kings, ſhewes helliſh rage, not common impudence. In his Raigne of ſixteene yeares, vntill this abominable Parliament, one only Peere of the Kingdome ſuffered death, &amp; that not for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, or offence againſt the Kings perſon, but for Crymes of another nature, a raritie in the ſtories of the beſt Kings, and yet ſo brutiſh is this man to ſay, that <hi>he hath offred at more cunning fetches to vndermine our liberties, and put Tyrany into an art, then any brittiſh King before him.</hi> Wherein ſhould Tirany appeare, was there any violence vſed in taking away mens Eſtates? Can they object Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetuouſnes, or luxury to his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> they have not yet pretended it, but they would make Tyrany by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, &amp; that Government which ſtands in their way
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95058:22"/>muſt be called Tyrany, and the want of inſtances of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany makes them thus giddily ſtagger from ſide to ſide; and talke of <hi>offring at more cunninge fetches,</hi> what doth this ſignifie? Doth this Author thinke, that he wilbe beleived in his ſlanders of Tyrany, when all is reſolved into <hi>offers,</hi> &amp; <hi>offers at cunning fetches,</hi> and all is only their malicious, &amp; inconſequent inferences? This Author well knowes this aſſertion of his, is ſo farr from truth, that he cannot name one Act of his Maj: wherevnto he, or his Maſters have excepted, that wants Example of his beſt Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, ſo wide hath he opened his mouth in ſaying more then any <hi>Brittiſh King</hi> before him. And his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> tooke not ſuch Examples, as thoſe men, that make Acts of violence, and Rebellion <hi>Examples,</hi> but ſuch Actions, as were <hi>by Councell,</hi> and in the <hi>way of law,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice.</hi> But this Author having ſo lately mentioned the old <hi>Engliſh fortitude,</hi> how falls he to name the Brittiſh Kings? If he intend the Kings, which the <hi>Romans</hi> found at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or which ſuceeded their departure, his compariſon is not of any large ſignification, for the Catalogue is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort, and the Actions leſſe, but perhapps he meanes to make <hi>Authenticke</hi> the ſtory of <hi>Geoffry of Monmouth,</hi> where the Catalogue bath as title truth, as the perſons Actions, he doth not meane the <hi>Saxons</hi> to be <hi>Brittiſh Kings?</hi> If he doe, he will finde among them not only <hi>offers at fetches,</hi> but open rapines, and homicides, which when he thinkes on, what he bath written might ſhame him, if he could ſhame at any thing, and if he thought knowing readers would have the patience to pervſe ſo much ſcurrilous language, and impudent vntruth, as he hath packt togeather in this booke, he would expect juſt reproach for offering at ſuch a Compariſon ſo imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95058:23"/>if he intended ſuch Kings only, as were properly termed <hi>Brittiſh</hi> in regard of diſcent, whoſe perſons, and Actions are ſo inconſiderable, and ſo lewdely falſe. If he intend all others, that have Raigned in England, whoſe ſtories conteine ſo evident a refutation of his vntruth.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Parliament of King James, there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate touching the Kings Title, which he deſired to have of <hi>greate Brittaigne</hi> in reguard of his Dominion over the whole Iſland, the lower howſe then reputed wiſe, much oppoſed it, and would reteine the name of <hi>England,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which name they ſaid their Anceſtours had been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. Theſe men tell vs noe contentions are infallible, but the preſent, and they are in love with the name of <hi>Brittiſh Kings,</hi> of whome they know nothing, that the people may forget their Engliſh Kings, that made them famous.</p>
            <p>Wee reade of ſome in Scripture, that wrought miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife by a law, and this Author, that talkes of making <hi>Tyrany</hi> an art, ſtrives to make Rebellion a law, and all Government a <hi>Tyrany,</hi> and having vndermined <hi>Monarc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hy</hi> with cantinge termes of <hi>Libertie,</hi> ſeekes to ſuppreſſe all <hi>Libertie</hi> by lawleſſe power. He doth not wonder, though he pretend it at the change in the people, for the many odious lyes, and ſlanders his Maſters have vſed of the King, the many promiſes they have falſified to the people, the cotinual oppreſſions they exerciſe over them juſtly provoke hatred to ſuch <hi>Tyrants,</hi> vnles the people were condemned to perpetuall ſtupiditie with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſlavery.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rebells,</hi> whome this Author reports to be <hi>Sainted,</hi> though they objected miſgovernment to their Kings, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were ſo impudent to pretend their lawes ſlavery, but

Their pretence of lawes is turned into ſickely fancies of diſtempered braines, &amp; though the leaders are hardened by their confirmed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, the people begin to recover their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſee the <hi>cunning fetches,</hi> whereby they were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined, and the Art, which Traytours vſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them.</p>

Its happy, if any men, that have gone farr in an evill way ſtopp, and returne to the right path. <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> Paul</hi> gloried, that men ſaid of him, that he now preacht the faith, which before he deſtroyed, &amp; if there be any, though of another name, and ſect in the ſenſe of this author, that preach loyaltie, which before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, Its Gods greate mercy to them, and that they reduce others from the errours of their way. Theſe Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterians may hence obſerve, how vnhappily they were engaged againſt the <hi>Prelates,</hi> and with this other ſect in ſettinge foorth contumelious, &amp; ſcoffing libells, that now have the ſame language caſt on themſelves by theiſe brethren in evill. Schiſme, &amp; Rebellion have noe meane,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95058:25"/>and he is much deceived, that thinkes to retaine either of them in any bounds without force, and this the <hi>Preſbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> now findes to his loſſe, who is growne as contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to thoſe he meant to rule, as he endeavoured to make the <hi>Prelates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides their <hi>pulpit ſtuffe</hi> he ſayes <hi>their lives the Tipe of all worldlines, and hipocriſie without the leaſt true patterne of vertue, righteouſnes, or ſelfe denyall in their whole practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of thoſe Markes, which the Scripture give for the Tryall of <hi>Hipocrites,</hi> what one doe theſe Rebells want, their pride in aſſuming holines to themſelves, &amp; denying it to others, is held foorth by them on all occaſions. <hi>Stand further from me, I am holier, then thou,</hi> was the old Jew, and <hi>Lord I thanke thee I am not, as other men, nor as this Publican</hi> was the reformed Phariſee, &amp; how impiouſly theſe Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours appropriate to themſelves righteouſnes, and ſelfe denyall, as if none, but Traytours could attaine the knowledge of ſuch graces? If <hi>righteouſnes</hi> confiſt in <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming God, contempt of his ordinances,</hi> and <hi>ſcorning the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of his <hi>ſaints,</hi> theſe men may lay ſome claime to it, And if ſuch, as <hi>deny</hi> not themſelves the lives, and Eſtates of others, that <hi>deny</hi> not themſelves any power, or pleaſure they like, be the true <hi>ſelfe denyers,</hi> we cannot exclude this Author, and his Maſters from attaining it? Doe theſe men imagine, that vſing the termes of <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes,</hi> and <hi>ſelfe denyall,</hi> which they have made much in faſhion, induces any man to thinke they eſteeme it, whoſe whole endeavours are <hi>ſelfe ſeeking?</hi> Can they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any man, that when our bleſſed ſaviour would pay Tribute, though not due from him, that he might not give offence, that the <hi>righteouſnes,</hi> which he commended to his ſervants was not only to deny Tribute, but to fight
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95058:25"/>againſt thoſe to whome it was due? Are they greater practiſers of <hi>ſelfe deniall,</hi> that preach warr, and blood ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then obey, then thoſe, that preach <hi>paſſive obedience,</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> rather then <hi>violence?</hi> Certenly the Alcaron Religion of theſe men, cannot entitle them to that <hi>Evangelycall vertue of ſelfe deniall,</hi> and their Actions being ſoe oppoſite to it, their frequent vſe of the word proves their confirmed hipocriſie, &amp; reſolved impenitencie. He may well wonder, if ſuch <hi>pulpit ſtuffe,</hi> and ſuch lives, as he mentions ſhould attract ſoe many from his old <hi>Engliſh fortitude.</hi> If he would have aſſigned a cauſe for ſuch an eminent change, as he ſuppoſes, it ſhould have been ſome way proportionable to the effect, and his beſt way had been to have advanced the knowledge, and ſubtile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> and their fellow teachers, but madd men only will beleive him, when he ſayes men groſſe in their doctrines, and offenfive in their lives per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the moſt part from the olde <hi>Engliſh fortitude,</hi> this ſhewes only a will to rayle, not ane Argument to prove. It wilbe an hard taſke for him to prove men the Tipe of worldlines, whome his Maſters have ſtript of all worldly meanes of living, and expoſed them, and their families to begg, or ſtarve. Was there ever a time in any one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when ſoe many have endured the ſpoyling of their goods, &amp; vndergone ſoe greate povertie from plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, rather then renounce their faith, &amp; former profeſſion, as the <hi>Prelates of England,</hi> and their <hi>follow tachers? hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,</hi> and <hi>worldlines</hi> conſiſt not with that condition, and in this Eſtate they cannot charge the <hi>Prelates</hi> with ray-ling, &amp; virulent language againſt their perſecutors, as the Rebell Miniſters vſed againſt their Governours.</p>
            <p>The people now diſcerne the difference betweene
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95058:26"/>the <hi>Prelates</hi> humilitie, and the pride of their preſent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſters, and that pride is leſſe incident to juſt Titles, then vſurpations, and that popular inſinuations never want am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and arrogance. The Biſhopps eminent vertues, and ſufferings are ſoe conſpicuous to all men, as cannot be obſcured by malicious detraction. But ſuch, as make it their ſin to preach <hi>paſſive obedience</hi> will judge Martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hipocriſie, and patience worldlineſſe.</p>
            <p>His next cauſe he attributes to the <hi>factious inclination of moſt men divided from the publique by ſerveral ends, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of their owne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Factious inclinations carry men to Rebellion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and private ends divided from the publique are excentrique to lawfull Government. All changes proceede from theſe ends, and humours, and ſubmiſſion to Rulers is inconſiſtent with them. But the Author will have the reſiſtance of parricide, and Rebellion an effect of factious inclination, as patience, and paſſive obedience to be a worldly doctrine; By his account Rebells only have care of the publique, and all that oppoſe them have ends divided from it. This humour of ſeditious Traytours hath been anciently diſcovered, and yet by the peoples vnhappy credulities never prevented, &amp; thence it comes, that they complaine of faction, and innovation, while they are buſie in contrivinge it. And it is noe wonder, that they, that have found ſoe many deceived by their diſſembled paſſions, will offer ſuch palpable abſurdities to the people, that men oppoſe them for private ends, &amp; that themſelves ſeeke only the publique, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by blood, and rapine they have got poſſeſſion of all the wealth, &amp; power of the Kingdome, and treade all vnder foote, that had right to rule They ſay truly they ſeeke the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95058:26"/>but all men ſee it is for their private ends, and ambition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At firſt noe man leſſe beloved, noe man more generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, then was the King from the time, that it became his Cuſtome to breake Parliaments at home, and cyther willfully, or weakely betray proteſtants abroade to the beginninge of thoſe combuſtions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He would prove the people inconſtant, who doubts it? there hath been proofe enough of it in their wretched levitie toſſed to, and fro by theſe Rebells. Bene facere, male audire Regium eſt, will not be denyed by Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſtes to be a knowne truth, and that it is the common lot of good Princes to be miſreported. That his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſt ſuffered by the privy whiſpes of ambitious ſeducers to the credulous vulgar is eaſily graunted, but it was their ingratitude, not his merit, and the Authors <hi>leſſe beloved and more generally condemned</hi> is a ſuppoſition voyde, of truth, as the Act it ſelfe was voyde of dutie, the cauſes he would have to be <hi>his Cuſtome in breaking Parliaments, and betraying Proteſtants.</hi> Let vs examine what ground there was, for this averſion from the King vpon either of theis. There were in the time of King James, men, that made ill vſe of Parliaments, and inſteede of amending what was amiſſe ſtrived to make the people beleive things were out of order, which they felt not, and to create diſcontents at the Government. This cauſed the breach of ſome Parliaments in that Kings time, his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> finding the people poſſeſt with great jealoſies of his match with ſpaine, &amp; greate deſires to breake the peace with that nation in order to the recovery of the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate became the inſtrument of ſetling a right vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge betweene the King, and his Parliament in the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95058:27"/>21. th. Yeare of his Raigne. Then was the Treatie of the match, and peace broken, the ſeſſion of Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to the greate joy of the people, and with their greate profeſſions of affection to his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> for ſoe happy a worke. King James was noe ſooner dead, and his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> by the Councell of the Parliament engaged in a dangerous warr, but the ſeditious contrivers, that had pretended ſuch Zeale for the regaininge of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate, caſt about how they might ruine his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> by that vndertaking, and in his firſt Parliament without reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to their owne promiſes, his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> merit from them in procuringe their deſires, or the publique neceſiſities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully withdrew their aſſistance from him, and ſpread abroade rumours againſt his Government, and when he called a Parliament, the private annimoſities, &amp; perſonall thirſt of revenge in ſome men were entertained in the houſe of Commons, to exclude the conſideration of the preſſing neceſſities of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> affaires, and forreigne agents had their fingers with theſe leaders in Parliament, to divert all ſupplies from his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> that both Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and all other his allies might be diſappointed, and which by that meanes was effected. Its well knowne with what induſtrie, &amp; difficultie his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of his neceſſities advanct releife to the Proteſtants, and if they were betrayed, the Treaſon muſt lie on the Parliaments credulitie to thoſe vnderminers, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke their King in the proſecution of that worke.</p>
            <p>To <hi>betray Proteſtants,</hi> theis Traytours know ſignifies much to the people, &amp; therefore they make it a reproach to their King againſt the knowne evidence of the fact, and all ſenſe, and though they hipocritically pretend af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> the world knowes, they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95058:27"/>doe not aſmuch, as give it a <hi>toleration,</hi> for the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doe not account <hi>Iohn of Leidon, and the mad men of Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Proteſtants,</hi> &amp; there is noe Religion, but theirs, now current in England.</p>
            <p>This Author ſees the cleerenes of the proofe againſt their malitious allegations of <hi>betraying Proteſtants,</hi> and therefore deſcends a little in his termes, and ſayes either <hi>wilfully, or weakely.</hi> Could he betray them by impotencie of force, or Councell? that a new found Treaſon, that the minde intends not, but its too much reſpect to ſuch an abſurd Calumnie to give it an anſweare.</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>all men inveighed againſt him, all men except Court vaſſalls oppoſed him, and his Tyranicall proceedings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inveighinge againſt the King was vnknowne in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land before ſuch Monſters, as this Author were hatcht by Rebellion, and made their words accord with their Actions, when their lying, and hipocriſie could noe lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſerve turne. Before this time malecontents muttered their cenſures of Government, and people that beleived them, thought it their ſin, and ſhame to inveigh againſt their King. Though diſcontents were nouriſht among many, few, or none were ſoe impudent to inveigh. There is noe Courtier, whoſe obſervance to his Prince, or his flatterie of him can binde him to like vaſſallage, as he is, that ſerves Rebells by falſe, and impudent detractions of Rulers. Noe ſlave ſoe baſe, as he, that wilbe hired to murther the fame, and honour of others. There are ſome Courtiers among his new Maſters, whoſe falſhood to their true Maſter, and baſe obſervance of the Traytours to him entitles them to the worſt of vaſſallage. This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor goes an ill way to prove Tyranicall proceedings, when he ſayes they were ſoe oppoſed. Its ſtrange a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95058:28"/>ſhould ſuffer himſelfe to be oppoſed, and how were thoſe Tyranicall proceedings oppoſed? he will ſay by diſputes in Courts of Juſtice, &amp; was this Tyrany to admit conteſtations in ordinary Courts? There was never time, wherein there were not queſtions of right betweene King, and ſubject, &amp; is it Tyrany in a Prince to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in a Proces? And doth this Author hold malicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and rumours notes of diſgrace vpon King, or any other Magiſtrate? good Princes lives confute detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and though the people for a time may be deluded, they will come to know a good King in his loſſe. Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious humours are an Epidemicall peſtilence, whoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence cannot continue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This full Parliament was at firſt vnanimous in their diſlike, and proteſtation againſt his evill Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hath not the leaſt colour of truth, and as there was never time, wherien ſomethinge was not to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſoe in the beginninge of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> there were things of that nature, but not ſuch, as laid Cryme vpon his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Government, nor did the Parliament judge ſoe, but all corruptions of Courts, Errours of Councell, ill ſucceſſes of Actions are charged by this Author, as his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ill Government, and every judgment of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in a particular caſe made a <hi>proteſtation</hi> againſt it.</p>
            <p>This Author cannot, but know, that the moſt <hi>vnami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous proteſtation,</hi> that ever the Parliament made was to defend the Kings perſon, honour, and Eſtate, and they, that made this <hi>proteſtation</hi> could not be <hi>vnanimous in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting</hi> againſt his evill Government, nor in deſtroying both him, and it. They proteſted to defend the lawes of the land, one of which they declared to be, <hi>that the King could doe noe wrong, and that if they ſhould ſay his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:95058:28"/>did, they ſhould ſpeake againſt the law, &amp; the affection of their owne hearts.</hi> Can this Author finde any roome heere for an <hi>vnanimous proteſtation of the Parliament againſt the Kings ill Government.</hi> And yet theſe were made long after the beginninge of the Parliament, but they, that have noe conſcience of ſpeaking truth, have noe ſhame to be convinced of falſhood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But when they, who ſought themſelves, and not the publique began to doubt, that all of them could not by one, and the ſame way attaine to their ambitious purpoſes, then was the King, or his name at leaſt, as a fit propertie firſt made vſe of, his doings made the beſt of, and by degrees juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is very induſtrious to finde out cauſes, why ſoe many would not be Traytours, why could he not fall into the conſideration of the oaths of Alleagiance, &amp; ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, that all members of Parliament take at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance? why could he not thinke on the proteſtation themſelves contrived to defend the King? how did he forget the Commaunds of obedience from God? If him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his Maſters had not preferred their ambitious ends before their dutie to God, or man, if they had not thought all oaths, and vowes of noe obligation againſt their ends, they would never have attributed other mens deſertion of their courſes to proceede from <hi>ambitious ends,</hi> Could men, that ſaw theſe Traytours making ſuch oaths, and proteſtations of loyaltie with a reſolution to breake them, run without remorſe with them? Could any, that retained any ſparke of Religion, or morall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie concurr with ſuch perſons in their lewde courſes? But all could not attaine their <hi>ambitious ends</hi> by the <hi>ſame way. What way?</hi> by deſtroying the King? wee are ſure ſome have attained their <hi>ambitious ends that way.</hi> And
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95058:29"/>doth this Author thinke, that any men had higher <hi>ends of ambition,</hi> then they, that now have attained theirs? if he doe, he hath very few of his minde, how ever there was <hi>a way to ambitious ends,</hi> but it was not wide enough for all, and who had theſe <hi>ambitious ends</hi> they, that tooke the way, or they, that left it. They that had obligations of honour, and conſcience for their wayes are vncharitably charged with <hi>ambitious ends,</hi> and they, that brake the bounds of dutie, and oaths to attaine their ends, are ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly pretended to ſeeke the publique.</p>
            <p>How the Kings name, and office hath been made a propertie, and all dutie, and oaths to him a Ceremony by the Traytours is knowne to the world. They have not ſpared any thing Religious, or Civill. They have made a propertie of the very name of God, of faſts, of thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, of prayers, of preaching. They have made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of Juſtice, of Delinquents, evill Councellours? how often have they made the lords houſe a propertie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it the Kings hereditary Councell? how often of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie? And how frequently in this very libell doth he make a propertie of the name of Parliament. All men ſee there hath been nothing reall with them, but their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and crueltie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which begate him ſuch a partie, as after many wiles, and ſtruglings with his inward feares imboldened him at length to ſet vp his ſtandard againſt the Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After many Meſſages to the Traytours, that poſſeſt both houſes of Parliament. After many offers to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh his juſt rights to take away all jealoſies, and feares of his power, which were then pretended. After many Remoſtrances, of the Calamities, that attend Civill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions. After the vndutiful rejections of al his motions
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95058:29"/>for peace. After the diſcovery of the vnſatiable ambition, and blood thirſtie malice of the prevailing partie. After the violation of all priviledges of Parliament. After the compulſion of the better part of both houſes to deſert them. After the ſeizing of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> forts, and Navy, and aſſuminge the Militia. After the longeſt, and moſt provokt patience, that ever King reteined, his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ſet vp his ſtandard againſt thoſe Rebells, that tooke the name of Parliament.</p>
            <p>But Iconoclaſtes remember, you have heere vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded feares to the King, when you come to deny he had any. What wiles were vſed to ſeduce the people, what jealoſies, &amp; ridiculous feares were blowne vp to diſorder them is yet freſh in Memory, and he well obſerves the Kings ſtandard at length ſet vp, for there was juſt cauſe to have done it long before, and much diſadvantage to his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> by the delay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When as before that time, all his adherents conſiſtinge moſt of diſſolute ſwordmen, and ſuburb royſters hardly amounted to the making vp of one ragged Regiment ſtrong enough to aſſault the vnarmed houſe of Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What time doth he meane the ſetting vp of the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard? If his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> had ſooner declared a gainſt the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, he had not wanted a greater <hi>Regiment.</hi> And if he had intended to aſſault the <hi>houſe of Commons,</hi> thoſe he had with him were enough to have done it, though thoſe, that then ſate had been <hi>armed,</hi> otherwiſe thoſe members would not have been abſent, when he eame.</p>
            <p>For the qualitie of the Kings adherents, as he Phraſes it, the perſons, that then waited on him were for the moſt part of better qualitie, then their Rebell Generall, whome now they adore. It was the art of one of the guides of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95058:30"/>this Treaſon at that time to ſtile ſuch, as were about the King <hi>Cavileers,</hi> as a name vnagreeable to the <hi>prickeard Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi> whoſe ſuperſilious demurenes made wry faces at ſuch a name, it being the Cuſtome of falſe Traytours to lay claime to thoſe behaviours, that may hide their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wolviſh diſpoſition, and defame others to get repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to themſelves, and thence <hi>ſuburb Royſters,</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſwordmen</hi> became names for ſuch, as followed the King to add terrour to the citizens of London, who have found more pride, crueltie, &amp; robbery among their ſchis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall pretenders to pietie, then any ſuch danger, as was threatned them from ſuch, as followed the King.</p>
            <p>Though this breaker would deſtroy the reaſon, and ſenſe of his readers, yet its impoſſible by ſuch incoherent Arguments, as he produceth. Can he hope any man will beleive him, that ſuch, as followed the King at that time to the lower houſe, were all, that tooke offence at the proceedings in Parliament, and that none els were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to aſliſt the King againſt the inivries offred him? That were too vnreaſonable conſidering the Actions both then, and ſucceedinge, and becauſe he had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to get more ſtrength, therefore he could not? But if the number of them, that had a right vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Kings affaires were very ſmall, doth it follow, that the contrary was the better becauſe numerous? The Author refutes it himſelfe in his next words, and ſurely the Argument is more ſtrong againſt the cauſe he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, that the people, that at firſt followed them have now left them, then the motions of the people carryed by rumours againſt their King in the beginning were of any Tyrany, or ill Government in him, for a people are eaſier ſtirred vp to follow an evill cauſe, then reduced af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95058:30"/>they have begun, and the qualitie, &amp; number of ſuch perſons, who have loſt their lives, and fortunes in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taning the Kings cauſe in regard of Eſtate, honour, and integritie, &amp; in Compariſon of ſuch, as Rebelled againſt him, might juſtly have withheld this Authors hand from objecting againſt their condition, for his owne partie muſt admire his impudence having ſuch evidence of the fact.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After which attempt ſeconded by a tedious, and bloody warr on his ſubjects, wherein he hath ſoe farr exceeded thoſe his arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary violences in time of peace, they, who before hated him for his miſgovernment, nay fought againſt him with diſplayed Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the field, now applaud him, &amp; extoll him for the wiſeſt, and moſt Religious Prince, that lived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let Iconoclaſtes ſhew other reaſon of this change, then the evidence of their former miſtake. Could it be <hi>ambitious ends,</hi> that made men extoll him, whome they had offended, and that after his impriſonment, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. After the defeate of his forces, &amp; noe expectation, but of oppreſſion vpon all ſuch, as expreſſed a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him? ſurely he hath abundantly requited his ſcornefull expreſſion of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ragged Regiment in the beginning, that heere tells vs after all his loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and loweſt condition, nay after death his very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies changed their thoughts of him. <hi>Repentance</hi> is a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate reproach among thoſe Rebells, the preaching of that doctrine is worſe to them, then <hi>paſſive obedience.</hi> That there were ſome, that hated his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> may be beleived, their tongues, and pens ſet on fire of hell have publiſhed it to the world. They that hate Chriſtian vertues, hate ſuch, as have them. They, that hate the ordinances of God, hate ſuch, as are appointed to exerciſe them, But it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95058:31"/>was only in ſome fiery ſchiſmatickes, whoſe pride diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with profeſſion of humilitie, at firſt appeared in their petulancy againſt their teachers, and at laſt came to exalt it ſelfe above all, that is called God. Theſe men perfectly hated the King, that hated all Government, and by this meaſure Iconoclaſtes would comprehend all ſuch, as through credulitie, or error a firſt fell into this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to beare Armes againſt their King. Doubtles they, that after this tedious, and bloody warr became more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate to his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> deſcerned not ſuch exceſſes on his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> part, as this Author ſuppoſes, for that had not been an Argument for a change. Its manifeſt to all, that his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Actions in this warr were noe other, then ſuch, as the neceſſitie of that condition drawes with it, and which the nobleſt Enemies vſe, &amp; his Enemies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce one Act done by him, which themſelves did not avow, and yet he ſayes in the warr he exceeded his Arbitrary violences in time of peace, and if wee take the word of Iconoclaſtes, they were not irregular, that the neceſſary Actions of warr did exceede, and by the way neither Iconoclaſtes, nor his Maſters for their juſtification have produced one Act of Arbitrary violence againſt his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> though they make outcryes of Tyrany, and violence to hide the vglines of their villany.</p>

               <hi>By ſoe ſtrange a Method amongst the madd multitude is a ſudden reputation won of wiſedome by willfullnes, and ſubtill ſhifts. Of goodnes by multiplying evill. Of pietie by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to roote out true Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is it only the <hi>multitude</hi> he meanes, in whome this ſtrange <hi>change</hi> is? that cannot be, for the ſevere procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of his Maſters againſt eminent perſons for deſerting their ſide, their purging the Parliament, as they call it, &amp;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95058:31"/>this Authors ſucceeding diſcourſe denote others, beſides the <hi>madd multitude.</hi> Its a ſtrange Method, that the <hi>madd multitude</hi> ſhould be moved to honour ſuffering vertue, which themſelves had perſecuted, were not the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without exception? And its not ſtrange, that ſuch, as knew not the King, but by the ſly inſinuations of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, ſhould come to the knowledge of their Errours by his eminent vertues in his ſufferings. The Method, that Iconoclaſtes calls ſtrange, is certainely as ſtrange, as the Method he takes to be beleived, for will any man give him credit, that after ſuch an averſion, as he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the people from the King vpon the pretence of his imprudence, and vnſoundnes in Religion, the people ſhould be drawne to an opinion of his <hi>wiſedome by will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes. Of goodnes by multiplying evill. Of pietie by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to roote out true Religion.</hi> Though the people were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> yet take them at the worſt, it they had hated him, becauſe they thought him evill, they would not be drawne to love him, becauſe they found him ſoe. Its not ſtrange, that the <hi>multitude</hi> finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cheated ſhould be aſhamed of their errour, and among other ſeducements, that cry of rooting out Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion made lowdeſt noyſe in the beginning of this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and this Author, and his fellowes have vndeceived the people, for they <hi>have rooted out all Religion,</hi> and left nothing, that hath the face of it. Did the people expect, that all the cry, that was made of Religion was to bring in Arrianiſme, Anabaptiſme, Socinianiſme, &amp; ſuch ſects, as they never heard of? was this the Religion they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to fight for? Its not ſtrange at all, that the <hi>mad multitude,</hi> who were inflamed with the reputation, and Authoritie of the Parliament comminge to ſee, that the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95058:32"/>orders, votes, &amp; other Trumperie, with which they were led on, were only the contrivance of a factious crew, ſhould abhorre them. That comminge to ſee the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parliaments, and ſcorne of the peoples Power, which at firſt was preached to them over their King, they ſhould bewayle their owne miſerie, that was ſoe vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily brought on them by their owne precipitation. The proofes of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> wiſedome, goodnes, and pietie are obvious to the meaneſt capacitie, and the ſublimeſt vnderſtandings have made his vertues, aſwell, as his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes their wonder, and though wee have lived in an age, where prodigies of villany are every day acted, this Author is a wonder to wiſemen, that makes a Method of lying, and diſſimulation: But as the Government of hell is confuſion, ſoe are the Arts and Method of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of that Enemy of mankinde, which confound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſobrietie, and ſoe, as they may contradict truth, care not to contradict themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is evident, that the cheife of his adherents, never loved him, never honoured him, nor his cauſe, but as they tooke him to ſett a face vpon their owne malignant deſignes, nor bemoane, his loſſe at all, but the loſſe of their owne aſpiring hopes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its evident the Author ſayes it, and evident, that it is without ground, or colour of truth. would men, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loved him, never honoured him, nor his cauſe, not only hazard, but looſe thier lyues, &amp; fortunes in defence of him, and his cauſe, and that when the beſt ſucceſſes they could hope for, could not equall the perils they ran? If there be either honour, or gallantry in any of thoſe, that call themſelves ſouldiers, &amp; Enemies to their King, and that Rebeilion hath not vnnaturalized them, they would hate ſuch an impudent Paraſite, that ſeekes to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95058:32"/>pleaſe them with ſuch impotent Calumines of perſons (whoſe worth, and honour they have ſoe often tryed) becauſe they were Enemies to his partie. What Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant deſignes would he have imagined, ſuch, as noe man ever dreamt of? Doth not this man beleive, that his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſee, he followes the common places of detraction without reſpect to the proprietie of perſons, or Actions? May not this language, that he vſed of any perſons, that follow a partie? was there ever in the world an Example of a cauſe proſecuted vpon more diſadvantage on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Kings partie?</p>
            <p>When a King is proſecuted by his ſubjects, Iconocla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes tells vs they that adheare to him doe it for <hi>malignant deſignes.</hi> Its certaine the Rebells had noe other, but wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>malignant deſignes,</hi> and whence came malignant deſignes in ſuch, as oppoſed them? Becauſe they Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, other men had malignant deſignes, and if any had malignant Deſignes, &amp; ſecrett diſaffections to the King, or his cauſe, doth he thinke it adds any weight to his ſlanders againſt the King? will he lay on him the faults of his partie? It ſeemes he thought ſome <hi>madder,</hi> then the <hi>multitude</hi> would reade his booke, otherwiſe ſuch traſh would not have been worth his binding vp, but he tooke this to make vſe of his Greeke, how the Captive women ſeemed to lament Patroclus, though in truth their owne condition, and thats the beſt of his evidence for this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and therefore he notes the booke, where it is.</p>
            <p>It muſt needes be ridiculous to any judgement vnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrald, that they, who in other matters expreſſe ſoe little feare either of God, or man, ſhould in this one particular outſtrip all Preciſianiſme with their Scruples, &amp; fill mens eares continually with the noyſe of conſcientious loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95058:33"/>and Alleagiance to the King, Rebells in the meane while to God in all their Actions beſides.</p>
            <p>It is ridiculous to any judgement vninthrald, that ſuch, as Rebell againſt their King ſhould pretend they are not Rebells to God, and that ſuch, as profeſſe Preciſianiſme in crying downe dances, and May-games ſhould expect to be beleived, that they feare God, or man, when in the meanetime they violate all oaths, and duty to God, and man. Have not this generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhewed to the world, that all their outward formalities were noe other, then the waſhing cleane of the outſide of the veſſell? Are ſuch fitt judges of conſcience, that pretended this Preciſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme he mentions, who made greate ſcruples, and caſes touching Ceremonies, and make noe bones of robbery, murther, and Rebellion? It was our ſaviours judgement, that they which neglected the greater matters of the law were moſt properly Hipocrites. Notwithſtanding their Preciſianiſme, that all men of any partie, or ſocietie ſhould be free from ſcandalous offences, where there are multitudes is without Example, and it could not be hoped in the beſt, and cleereſt cauſe, that all, that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed it ſhould have ſincere ends, but none could have leſſe feare of God, or man, then he, that would make all guiltie of the Crymes of ſome, that for particular crymes of men will take the Devills office to accuſe all their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He makes it not in among the number of ſcruples, &amp; caſes, whether Rebellion be a ſin, but holds it a cleere caſe to be none? And then why not Idolatry, adulterie, and what not? Its poſſible, &amp; probable to any judgment vninthrald, that ſome men may make ſcruples of ſome ſins, &amp; are peccant in diverſe others, and its farr from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have greateſt remorſe of ſins, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95058:33"/>of whoſe guilt it moſt evident to their conſciences. But this Author doth not love the noyſe of <hi>conſciencious loyaltie,</hi> &amp; had rather noe <hi>conſcience</hi> then any <hi>loyaltie.</hi> The particular Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of ſome, that followed his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> cauſe, and made warr againſt him by their ſins have been lamented, and reproved out of Chriſtian zeale, not hipocriticall auſteritie, nor can any judgement from thence draw any concluſion againſt the cauſe they have followed, nor convince them of ſiniſter ends in following it.</p>
            <p>But is not a Rebell to his King a Rebell to God? The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers among thoſe Rebells have had a long heart riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Rulers, &amp; to take men of from being tender in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt their King, when ever they reproved any ſin that terme of <hi>Rebellion againſt God</hi> came with it, inſinuating a diſtinction of Rebellion againſt Princes, from <hi>Rebellion againſt God,</hi> yet Rebellion againſt Princes is a ſin againſt God, &amp; they cannot free themſelves of the greateſt guilt of ſin, that ſeduce men into it, &amp; handle the word of God deceitefullie, &amp; ſuch, as open a gate to Riebellion againſt Princes by transferring the Terme from the moſt ordinary ſignification, and applying it wholy to the borrowed ſenſe, ſeeke to get ſlaves to hell, not ſaints to heaven: Theſe were the infuſions of their ordinary lecturers, and ſerves aptly for the Rebell Politiques.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Much leſſe, that they, whoſe profeſſed loyaltie, and Alleagiance led them to direct Armes againſt the kings perſons, &amp; thought him nothing violated by the ſword of hoſtilitie drawne by them againſt him, ſhould now in earneſt thinke him violated by the vnſparing ſword of Iuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What meanes he in this? Is it much leſſe ridiculous in theſe latter, then the former? The forme of his Period went, as if he meant to make a gradation to the greater, and I thinke he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, and an errour of the preſſe; for ſure nothing is more ridiculous, then to thinke the King nothing violated by the ſword of hoſtilitie, whome he meanes wee muſt gueſſe, for he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95058:34"/>cannot name them, but by circumlocution. There is a greate difference betweene the <hi>ſword of Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>the ſword of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilitie,</hi> &amp; betweene the ſword of lawles violence, &amp; the ſword of juſtice, &amp; Chriſtians never thought, that any ſword drawne by ſubjects againſt their King did not violate their loyaltie, &amp; Alleagiance, much leſſe, that their profeſſed loyaltie, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagiance led them to direct Armes againſt the Kings perſon: If loyaltie leade to hoſtilitie, it were an ill foundation of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Truth is not leſſe wounded by lying, then loyaltie by Armes againſt the King. Some doubtles foreſaw not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of their beginnings, and being deceived by wrong principles fel into vnhappy concluſions, which they ſuſpected not to follow from their premiſſes, but as they are deceived, that wil ſever abſurd concluſions from erroneous premiſſes, ſo are they, that wil hope to avoy de deſperate conſequents from ill grounded Actions.</p>
            <p>Doth Iconoclaſtes hold it neceſſary, that al they, that have fallen into an impietie, muſt be impenitent, and becauſe they have been ſinners, muſt they become Blaſphemers, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtats? There have beene Examples of many Rebells, that yet abhord the ſhedding of their Kings blood. But Iconoclaſtes holds it a dishonour to be a ſmal villaine, &amp; he that wilbe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked muſt act Crymes of the higheſt degree, &amp; if he faile in the laſt Act, he muſt be thruſt from the ſtage. The more impious the Actions of Traytours are, the more evident the guilt of them, the greater prayſes they give them, and moſt magnifie that, which is moſt abominable, &amp; they ſtile their moſt outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious crueltie <hi>vnſparing Iuſtice.</hi> As they will ſpare noe mans blood to paſſe to their ends; ſoe they wil not be ſparing in the Titles of their villanies; If this ſhameles man had not been ſenſible of the vinverſall deteſtation of the fact, he mentions, &amp; that it was acted in defiance of Religion, law, &amp; Juſtice, he would never have choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this expreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>vnſparing ſword
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95058:34"/>of Iuſtice.</hi> If Rebels may judge of Juſtice, the cleereſt Juſtice wil become the fowleſt Cryme, &amp; the Juſtice that inflicts puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on their Rebellion the greateſt Tyrany; Lawes are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, where Malefactours have got the Tribunall. The <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparing ſword</hi> of Rebellion will noe more appeare the ſword of Juſtice, then the <hi>vnſparinge</hi> virulency of a lewde tongue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare a legall condemnation of a lawfull Magiſtrate. Is it <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparing Iuſtice,</hi> that gives the ſword into every hand, that would kill, and reproach full language into every <hi>falſe tongue?</hi> If there be offenders, they, that without authoritie take one them to puniſh, are more guiltie, then the offender: But wee may be aſſured, where Rebels, &amp; vſurpers are Judges, innocence wilbe the greateſt Cryme, and horrid Murthers vnſparing Juſtice.</p>
            <p>But he proceedes to ſay, <hi>which undoubtedly ſoe much the leſſe in vaine ſhee beares among men, by how much greater, and in higheſt place the offender.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This neede explication. He ſpake but now of the <hi>ſword of Iuſtice,</hi> and now ſayes <hi>ſhee beares,</hi> this if fome new ſpeculation. St. Paul ſayes the Magiſtrate beares not the ſword in vaine, and this man would have every man the Magiſtrate, and the ſword borne without an hand to ſtrike with it, &amp; Juſtice exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by a Metaphor. He makes <hi>Iuſtice</hi> ſome wandring ſpirit, that inviſibly carries a ſword. Whence comes the ſentence of this <hi>Iuſtice</hi> from the mouth of the Cryminall, or the Judge? for by thoſe motions both may lay equall claime to it, &amp; becauſe juſtice ought to be adminiſtrated impartially, ſuch, as are in higheſt place, &amp; from whome alone the adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is derived to all others muſt be murthered by thoſe that are ſubject to them? Juſtice hath noe ſword, but the power of the lawfull Magiſtrate, which is called the ſword of Juſtice from the Magiſtrates duty, &amp; becomes the ſword of violence, &amp; murther in the hands of another, but theis men thinke they may vſe the ſword without a calling as preach, and adminiſter
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95058:35"/>the Sacraments vncalled. Would Iconoclaſtes be content, that the Bayliffe of weſtminſter ſhould draw the impartiall ſword of Juſtice againſt his new Maſters, that are in higheſt place?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Els Inſtice, whether morall, or politicall were not Iuſtice, but a falſe counterfeite of that impartiall, and godlike vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iuſtice</hi> cannot become <hi>noe Iuſtice,</hi> but the Acts of men may be juſt, or vnjuſt, as they follow, or forſake the Rules of <hi>Iuſtice.</hi> And what greater contempt of Juſtice, then to pretend it for the ruine of mankinde? What grater reproach to that <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vertue,</hi> then to proſtitute it to all the execrable Parricides of the world? Doth the Image breaker thinke, that having called it a <hi>Godlike vertue,</hi> he hath well defined it by King kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for that is the ſenſe of his higheſt place? Its a part of his Method to inſinuate an opinion of his eſteeme of Juſtice by the prayſe of it, &amp; that ſuch, as he oppoſes were leſſe Zealous of it, but his context ſhewes, that <hi>Iuſtice</hi> is defyed by him, and he ſeekes to waſh the bloody hands of the worſt of Traytours by caſting their odious acts on his <hi>imaginary Iuſtice.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce comes Iconoclaſtes to aſſume the expreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a <hi>Godlike vertue,</hi> and is ſoe angry with Iconbaſilice? Is there more warrant for his <hi>Godlike vertue</hi> of Juſtice, then for the <hi>Godlike</hi> office of Kings? And he is as much Iconoclaſtes of the one, as the other, for they, that will wreſt the ſword out of the hands of Gods vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents will not ſticke to wreſt that <hi>Godlike vertue</hi> to their owne impieties</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The only greife is, that the head was not ſtrucke of to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and commoditie of them that held it by the haire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtles they, that ſtruke it of did it for their owne <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and commoditie</hi> without reſpect to Juſtice, or feare of God, and ſure if ſome were greived, that it was not ſtrucke of to their <hi>advantage,</hi> they, that ſtrucke it of did it to that purpoſe, and to the fatisfiction of their owne crueltie, and laying the foundation of their Tyrany, this followes from Iconoclaſtes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95058:35"/>for that <hi>commoditie,</hi> which ſome had, and others miſſed cauſed the Murther. <hi>They, that hold it by the haire, and they, that ſtrucke it of have cauſe of</hi> greife, though Iconoclaſtes, and his Maſters, that have, as they thinke the <hi>advantage, and Commoditie</hi> of it, now laugh at their partners, whome they put by, and at the wickednes they acted, and himſelfe gives ſtronger evidence, that the ring-leaders of this horrid Rebellion ſought their owne <hi>commoditie, and advantage,</hi> then can be ſuppoſed of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant deſignes</hi> in any of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> partie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which obſervation, though made by a common Enemy, may for the truth of it heereafter become a proverbe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wicked Actions are not the leſſe odious for Companie, and the obſervation, which it ſeemes he intends, that ſome of their partie, that now forſake them, were equally guiltie with them of the Kings death, will noe way excuſe them, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to that high degree of impietie. But why is the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator called a <hi>common Enemy?</hi> Why is he more an Enemy, then they, that reproach the preſent Murtherers, as much, as he? Their Enemies are now all man kinde, and ſuch, as beleived not their intentions, nor Actions cannot be deceived of them now they are defended by this Author. If that obſervation <hi>become a proverbe,</hi> will not the wickednes of theis Murtherers become a Proverbe to denote the greateſt degree of villany?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as to the Author of thoſe ſoliloquies, where it were the late King, as is vulgarly beleived, or any ſecret Coadiutor, and ſome ſticke not to name him, it can add nothing, nor ſhall take from the weight (if any be) of reaſon, which he brings.</hi> How the Champion traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his ground. At firſt he looked with greate ſcorne to have ſuch an <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> as a King, then he condeſcends <hi>to take vp the gantlet,</hi> then as an induction to his Trayterous reproaches craves excuſe for <hi>not vſing Courtſhip,</hi> &amp; now he makes a doubt, whether the King, or ſome <hi>coadiutor be Author of thoſe ſoliloquies,</hi> and he ſayes <hi>ſome ſticke not to name him.</hi> Truly its noe ſecret, or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95058:36"/>ſtrange thing, that there be not men wanting, that would not <hi>ſticke</hi> at any Action, or word againſt the King. Is it the neerer truth, when ſome ſticke not to name the man, when Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſtes <hi>ſtickes</hi> not at ſoe many vntruths? He, that reades this Authors booke will reſt aſſured, that he will <hi>ſticke</hi> at the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of nothing, that may diſhonour his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> But its ſtrange he thought his inſinuation of any weight, that ſome <hi>ſticke</hi> not to name him, when all men ſee the licence taken by ſo many lewde perſons, &amp; noe reſtraint from ſaying any thing againſt the King, whereat ſhould they <hi>ſticke,</hi> their impudence is commended, and rewarded? Would they <hi>ſticke</hi> at truth, thats out of faſhion in the new ſtate? But perhapps they <hi>ſticke</hi> to name a man, leaſt they have a conviction from him, or ſome els, that could diſcover the Circumſtances about it. But ſince he makes a ſcruple, if there be not reaſon in the booke, why is he ſoe vnwilling to admit the King to be the Author, ſurely it were for his advantage to make the King author of ſuch a booke, and if they were a <hi>Coadiutors,</hi> why doth he lay his weakenes, or errours, as he pretends vpon the King. The Author doth not add, nor take away from the reaſon in the booke, but the booke commends the Author, and ſhames the anſweare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But allegations, not reaſons are the maine contents of this booke, and neede noe more, then other contrary allegations to lay the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before all men in an even ballance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The allegations in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke are either ſuch, as are only knowne to himſelfe, or ſuch, as were evident to all men by the light of reaſon, or notorietie of Actions. And Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſtes vainely flatters himſelfe, that his contrary allegations wilbe of any weight to move the ſcale. Sober men take his oſtentation of confidence rather as an effect of frenſy, then a perſwaſion of reaſon, But through his whole booke he offers allegations againſt apparent reaſons.</p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:95058:36"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Though it were ſuppoſed, that the Teſtimony of one man in his owne caſe affirminge, could be of any Moment to bring in doubt, the authoritie of a Parliament denying a contrary allegation againſt this, would weigh downe the ballance in moſt mens judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The periuries, impoſtures, cruelties, &amp; devaſtations of thoſe he calls the Parliament are ſoe knowne, &amp; common abroade, that the mention of them is a name of infamy, and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all credit from their Actions. Their owne journalls tell the world, that they never ſpeake truth, but for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and omit noe falſhood, that will ſerve their turne. But doth Iconoclaſtes thinke any Parliament infallible, or that all men condemned by Parliament had Juſtice done them? He wil then finde, that they condemne one another, and for this laſt miſnamed Parliament, their bloody executions have ſuch apparent markes of Injuſtice, and cruelties, as themſelves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny it, vnles they will deny the records themſelves have made, &amp; the Teſtimony of former Parliaments. There are in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke many particulars, that the Parliament nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, nor could deny, and through the whole booke the Author hath produced few, or none of their denyalls. There hath been much vſe made of the name of Parliament, but the Author muſt thinke he hath an inchanting pen, if after the murther of the king, abolishing the Lords houſe, plucking out the members from the lower houſe, proſtituting the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Parliament to the lawleſſe multitude, and packing the Roome with a few meane perſons, eyther terrified by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, or flattered by promiſes, he can perſwade any, that ſuch a Company ſitting on the vſuall ſeates of the lower houſe be the Parliament, he may as well give the name of Parliament to a Pariſh veſtry, as that Convention, all the odds is the place of their meetinge.</p>

               <hi>But if theſe his faire ſpoken words ſhalbe heere fairly confronted, and laid parallell to his owne farr differing deedes manifeſt, &amp; viſible to the whole nation, then &amp;c.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat, which the King lajes downe, as his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that he called this laſt Parliament not more by others advice, and the neceſſitie of his affaires, then by his owne choice, and inclination, is to all knowing men ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently vntrue, that a more inauſpicious Sentence could hardly have come into his minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> intention could be apparent to all knowing men, muſt have better Authoritie, then this Authors word to be beleived. His Majeſt beſt knew his own intentions, and ought to be credited againſt the Malicious conjectures of ſuch, as ſeeke matter of ſlander againſt him to ſhelter their owne impieties, never King of England ſhewed greater affection to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> and never King found greater ingratitude. His frequent coming to Parliaments in his Fathers Raigne. His many good offices done the houſes, and the larg acknowledgments of their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him are vpon the Records of both houſes. Vpon the death of his Father he inſtantly called a Parliament, ſeeking to continue the ſame vnderſtanding betweene him, and his houſes, as there had been in the time of his Father. He had then entred into a dangerous warr with Spaine vpon the Parliaments Councell, was in preparation of a greate fleete, ſtood charged with a greate debt left on him by his Father, beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des deepe engagements to his Allies abroade, the ſupplies the then Parliament gave him were two Subſidies, he then deſired an addition
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95058:38"/>only of fortie thouſand pound, which was refuſed him. If any man ſhall ſay now, that the King called not that Parliament of his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, becauſe he was diſcontented to be ſo dealt with by them, knowing men will hardly beleive him, &amp; ſuch men, as are juſtly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with factions in Parliament, might truly affect them, when they are rightly diſpoſed, and this Sentence, which Iconoclaſtes holds ſo inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious imports not that, which his falſe Augurie Prognoſticates, for though his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> received provocations, and cauſes of diſlike from ſeverall Parliaments, it followes not, that he could have no intention to call one, when there was a probabilitie of removing the cauſes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſorders, which his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> expreſſes in his enſuing diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The inclination of a Prince is beſt knowne by thoſe next about him, or by the current of his Actions. Theſe neereſt this King were Courtiers, and Prelates, and it was their Continuall exerciſe to diſpute, and preach againſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Actions of others Iconoclaſtes would thinke them a weake proofe of his intentions, though the perſons were very neere him, and though there were preaching, and diſputes againſt the proceedings of ſome Parliaments, its no proofe of the Kings intentions, nor theirs, that vſed them againſt the right vſe of Parliaments, and the proceedings of ſome Parliaments might give juſt occaſion to men to ſay <hi>the King (they hoped) would have no more neede of them</hi> and it is a very greate happineſſe of any ſtate not to neede them, the neceſſitie of them proceeding from want, and danger, and there was a time, when people held Parliaments a burthen to hem, and thoſe in Parliament claimed it, that they were not bound to attend the Parliament above fortie dayes, and our owne ſtories tells vs of an <hi>indoctum Parliamentum, and inſanum Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> And doth Iconoclaſtes thinke, that all ſuch, as were out of love with ſuch Parlaments had no affection to any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was</hi> (he ſajes) <hi>but the Coppy, which his Paraſites had induſtriouſly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his owne words, and Actions, who never called a Parliament, but to ſupply his neceſſities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such, as have obſerved the inclinations of perſons neere his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> finde non greater Paraſites, then ſuch, as proved Traytours to him, and Paraſites are not wanting to other powers, as wel, as Kings, for we finde by this Author what men will do to pleaſe their Maſters eyther by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitiouſnes to their perſons, or the performance of villanie againſt others. This Author ſpends his mouth in vaine following his common place of Paraſites, and Courtiers, when the Actions he mentions are ſo farr from reflecting vpon his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> as they leave the blemiſh vpon the Relatour. That his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> had neceſſities, when he called a Parliament is knowne to all, &amp; the cauſes of them, but that he was ready all wayes to heare, and redreſſe the juſt greivances of his people could never yet be contradicted by the experience in any Parliament, al though the Author ſay, <hi>having Supplied theſe, he ſuddenly, and nominiouſty diſſolved
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95058:38"/>it without redreſſing any one greivance of the people.</hi> But if the Parliaments never preſented to him on greivance to be redreſſed, which he denyed, where lies the ignominie? It ſeemes the Author takes not the petition of right to be of that nature, for that was graunted by the King, and that conceſſion of his was then judged as greate an Act to the redreſſe of greivances, as ever King of England graunted his people. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſt; ſummoned three Parliaments before the ſhort Parliament at the beginning of theſe troubles, and in non of theſe were there any grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances preſented by the Parliament to the King to be redreſſed, but that petition of right, vnles a Remonſtrance againſt the Duke of Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham be reckned in that number, and if the people, had juſt grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to be redreſſed, they had juſt cauſe of complaint againſt thoſe Conventions, and of late repentance for their credulitie, that depended ſo much on them, that ſo little regarded their Sufferings. If we looke vpon the length of time, wherein theſe Parliaments ſate, wee ſhal finde ſeſſions concluded, &amp; diverſe good lawes made in the like ſpace of time in the Raignes of former Kings, and whoever lookes to the journalls of the houſes in theſe Parliaments of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> or whoever was preſent in them muſt confeſſe, that thoſe, that governed in the lower houſe minded nothing leſſe, then the redreſſe of greivances, or making of lawes, which were formally talked of to entertaine time, while pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate annimoſities, and perſonall revenges were made the ſole buſines of importance, &amp; in the ſpace of fower moneths no one greivance was prepared to be preſented to his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> and Iconoclaſtes heapes vp vntruths without reſpect to the apparence of their detection, for this firſt Parliament was ſo far from being ſuddenly diſſolved after the King was ſupplyed, that the greate Plague not permitting them to ſit longer at weſt minſter, his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> adiourned them to Oxford, and in another Parliament after the ſupply given him, there was a ſecond meeting, which might have had a longer continuance, if it had inſiſted on the redreſſe of greivances, but whence takes he the occaſion to ſay <hi>Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly</hi> diſſolved. Where was the <hi>Ignominie?</hi> Had not his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall right to do it? And if the houſes would not agree in the redreſſe of greivances, and ſupply of the neceſſities of the Kingdome, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance would prove ignominious, not their diſſolving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sometimes chuſing rather to miſſe of his ſubſidies or to rayſe them by illegall courſes, then that the people ſhould not ſtill miſſe of their hopes to be releived by Parliaments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Iconoclaſtes in his Preface talked of laying parallel actions to words, and heere he vſes words of actions, that never were, for among thoſe Parliaments of his late Majeſt; where can he finde a number to make vp his <hi>Sometimes,</hi> vſing a language, as if the King had called as many Parliaments, as he had raigned yeares? And where can he finde, that the King choſe to miſſe his ſubſidies, that the people ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95058:39"/>by Parliaments. Two of the Parliaments are already mentioned. In the third, where he had non, he was ſo farr from chuſing to miſſe of his ſubſidies, if he might have had them, that his reiterated Meſſages to the then houſe of Commons to prepare their greivances, that he might apply juſt remedies to them, ſufficiently prove, that nothing was wanting of his part to have received the ſubſidies, and releived the people; Its well knowne, that his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> had at that time a warr with Spaine, and France, and that nothing, but inevitable neceſſitie on his part, could have made him decline the obtaining of ſubſidies from that Parliament. And after the houſe of Commons had declared, that they would ſupply him <hi>in ſuch a way, and in ſo ample a meaſure, as ſhould make him ſafe at home, and feared abroade,</hi> they agreed vpon the number of ſubſidies, but voted, that the Bill ſhould not come into the houſe, till their <hi>greivances</hi> were anſweared. His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ſent them there vpon ſeverall Meſſages to haſten them to preſent the <hi>greivances,</hi> which nothing wrought on them, but without any reaſon after long expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they denyed to have the bil of ſubſidies brought into the houſe. Its wel known, that no Kingdome had leſſe <hi>greivances,</hi> then that of England vnder his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> And the people were perſwaded into an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of greivances, not by ſence of Suffering, but the diſputes of Pragmaticall Incendiaries, and they would have reſted quiet, had they not been ſeduced by ſuch Craftsmen, and there is no on thing, that this breaker can name for a <hi>greivance,</hi> which his Maſters, that now Lord it, do not encreaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt he broke of at his coming to the Crowne for no other cauſe, then to protect the Duke of Buckingham againſt them, who had accuſed him, beſides other hainous Crymes, of no leſſe, then poyſoning the deceaſed King his Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Author takes himſelfe not concerned in ſpeaking Truth, for the publike Records of the Kingdome, and ſome late declarations of the pretended Parliament would have held his hand from this falſe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, if he had valued Truth at the rate of peruſing them, for the <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> was not at all accuſed by the firſt Parliament of the King, nor in any Parliament for poyſoning the deceaſed King. He might have found, that in the ſecond Parliament of the King, Among other Articles againſt the <hi>Duke of Buckingham,</hi> he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for a <hi>Tranſcendent Preſumption, and of dangerous conſequence</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Phiſicke applyed to the deceaſed King, but the malice of ſuch, as hated the Duke of Duckingham did not extend to an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of poyſoning the deceaſed King, yet the venome of Treaſon in this Author makes him madd, and ſay, that a fact <hi>of preſumption, and of dangerous conſequence</hi> was <hi>a poyſoning.</hi> If ſuch were the wiſedome of a houſe of Parliament to call poyſoning of a King, a preſumption of dangerous conſequence neither King nor people neede be troubled to want their Councell. This is the firſt inſtance, though not the firſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95058:39"/>falſhood of Iconoclaſtes, but to the matter of what he ſajes in that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Parliament, wherein in <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> was accuſed, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſt: by Meſſage to the lower houſe told them, he was well pleaſed they ſhould proceede againſt the Duke of Buckingham they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly give vp their Articles to the Lords, the <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> made his anſweare, which was ſent down to the Commons, who being vnable to reply to it, ſuch, as then ſwayed the houſe contrary to the Councell of a greate number of the moſt experienced amongſt them reſolved to hinder al proceedings, and neceſſitate the King to a Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Parliament. This is no ſecret, the journall bookes of that houſe ſufficiently evince it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Still the latter breaking was with more affront, and indignitie put vpon the houſe and her worthyeſt members, then the former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This appeares not by his ſubſequent reaſon, but if this breaker had thought either the <hi>diſſolving of Parliaments, or indignitie, and affront to members</hi> and offence, why does he take on him the defence of thoſe, that have <hi>Ignominiouſly</hi> excluded the whole houſe of Lords, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Commons, and among them ſome, whome he termes the <hi>worthieſt perſons</hi> in the Parliament he ſpeakes of, but his reaſons, and narrations are of the ſame ſtuffe; And if any man compare the <hi>affronts,</hi> and <hi>indiginties</hi> offered his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> by ſome perſons in parliament, and his proceedings againſt them, he will judge, that their provacations exceeded his paſſion, and their owne ſufferings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In ſo much, that in the fifth yeare of his Raigne in a Proclamation he ſeemes offended at the very Rumour of a Parliament divulg'd among the people, as if he had taken it for a kinde of ſlander, that men ſhould thinke him that way exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable much leſſe inclined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What ſtrawes this man pickes vp. If the King did ſeeme offended at a factious <hi>Rumour,</hi> doth it follow, that he held it a Scandall to act that, which was <hi>Rumoured.</hi> Becauſe a King doth forbid <hi>Rumours</hi> of his intended Actions, doth he not therefore intend them? And muſt his Councells be the ſubject of common <hi>Rumour?</hi> It is a factious prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to ſpreade a Rumour of a parliament, before the King pleaſe to declare it, and tends to the precipitation of his Councells by ſedition. But as his premiſſes are <hi>(he ſeemes)</hi> ſo his concluſions are <hi>(as if)</hi> and men may aswell beleive him on his bare word, as ſuch inferences he appearing inexorable to ſpeake Truth, or forbeare ſlander.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And forbidds it, as a preſumption to preſcribe him any time for Parliaments that is to ſay, eyther by perſwaſion or petition, or ſo much, as the reporting of ſuch a Rumour, for other manner of Preſcribing was at that time not ſuſpected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> therein forbad no more then the law forbidds, and accounts it a preſumption to <hi>Preſcribe</hi> him any time for Parliaments. But ſuch, as have deſtroyed King, and Parliament would
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95058:40"/>have it eſteemed ſtrange, that they ſhould not preſcribe what they lift, and the breaker, that would have the King <hi>Preſcribed</hi> will allow non to <hi>Preſcribe</hi> his now maſters. His explanation ſignifies nothing, for doth he thinke, that the King ought to be petitioned, or perſwaded by every on, that will, or that the ſpreading of a Rumour is a fit meanes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to call a Parliament? He endeavours to defame the King for reſtrayning popular licence, and Sedition, and when he ſeekes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Tyranny of his Maſters, he reproaches the people with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, and violence; And the wayes of <hi>Preſcribing</hi> by him mentioned were vnorderly, and by him particulariſed as Plauſible, not ſound, <hi>other manner of Preſcribing was then not Suſpected,</hi> he intends the force of a ſcotts Army, and though he commend that way of Preſcribing, and attribute the calling of the Parliament to it, and accuſe the King for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting it, yet he will charge the King with beginning the warr.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By which feirce Edict, the people forbidden to complaine, as well, as forced to ſuffer began from thence foorth to deſpaire of Parliaments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people have now greater cauſe to <hi>diſpaire of Parliaments</hi> then ever they had in the time of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> for if theſe men prevaile, they are ſure never to have more, for they profeſſe to introduce a new form of Government which hath nothing of the Parliament of England &amp; however the people by ſeditious practices, or falſe apprehenſions, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of Parliaments,</hi> that proves nothing of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> inclination, or averſenes to Parliaments. How an edict can be called feirce, where no puniſhment of the breach of it appeares to be denounced, nor any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritie enſuing it, cannot be imagined, but its well knowne what Titles this Author wil give to any of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Actions reſpecting only the reproachfullnes of the Termes, nor their proportion, or congruitie to what they are applyed, and whoever lookes on the time, while Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were intermitted, the ſufferings of the people were leſſe, then when Parliaments were frequent, &amp; they neede not be forbidden to complaine, when their peace, &amp; plentie were a reaſon ſtrong enough to reſtraine them, however querulous murmurings wrought by ſeditious contrivers, may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ought to be forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in al juſt Governments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where vpon ſuch illegall Actions, and eſpecially to get vaſt ſumms of mony were put in Practice by the King, and his new Officers, as Monopolies, compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive knighthoods, Coate, Conduct, and Shipmony, the ſeezing not of on Nabaoths Vineyard, but of whole inheritances, vnder the pretence of forreſt, or Crowne lands, Corruption, &amp; bribery compounded for with impunities graunted for the future, as gave evident proofe, that the King never meant, nor could it ſtand with the Reaſon of his affaires ever to recall Parliaments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the pretences of Tyranny, and oppreſſion, wherewith the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells have ſought to maske their diſloyaltie are reduced to this on ſumme to get money. That Princes muſt have ſupplies from their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople for ſupport of the Kingdome cannot be doubted, and where the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95058:40"/>lawes have given the King a richt to demaund money of partioular perſons in certanie caſes, or of the whole people, theis are no illegall exactions, but due debts. The King of England is entitled by law to diverſe dues from his ſubjects, and of ſuch things his learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and his Judges have the care, that he looſe not his rights, and they are bound by oath to preſerve them, &amp; if in any caſes they faile in their judgment, their King cannot be guiltie of illegall exactions in follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing their Councell, and of ſuch nature are the particulars he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vnles Coate, and Conduct money, which had been disburſed by the Counties for the preſent, where ſouldiers were rayſed, and was of inconſiderable value and to be repayed, and only of practice in caſe of warr when neceſſitie requires greater contributions, and ſuch Actions, as theis the beſt Governments could never avoyde, and thoſe formes of Government, which theis Rebells Preferr before Monarchy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nairly practis, but they muſt ſupply with exclamations, what they want of matter, and having broken all bounds of dutie, Juſtice, and humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they ſeeke to make the common meanes, which neceſſitie compells Governnours to vſe for publique ſupport, the height of oppreſſion, and Tyranny. The vaſt ſumms received by all the wayes were farr ſhort of that greate charge, which the Kingdome required, and of what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Kings had received in the like ſpace, but inconſiderable in regard of the preſent exactions. He reſembles the legal proceedings in caſes of civil right to Nabaoths vineyard; ſo as al ſuites for recovery of deteined rights is the getting of Nabaoths vineyard, but they that by the blood of many Naboaths have gotten their inheritances would have Civill Controverſies, not bloody murther the ſin of Ahab. <hi>Corruption, and bribery compounded for</hi> with impunitie for the future is a denomination, which cannot be fixt to any Actions of <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> That his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> hath a power to pardon was never denyed, and therefore no act of grace in that kinde can be illegall, but this, which they call corruption, and bribery was no other, then the fees, which ſome officers received, and were queſtioned to be above their due, &amp; had they been convict, their mulct was pecuniary, and due to the King. They vrged long Cuſtome in their defence, and in a caſe of that nature, where only errour, not corruption, or bribery can be admitted, it was neerer to juſtice, then favour to forbeare profecution; And as the fact was not illegal, ſo had it been, it was only theirs, by whoſe Councell it was done, and theis men, that profeſſe ſuch zeale againſt corruption, and bribery, pretend, that it was neceſſary to take away the ſtarr chamber, where ſuch Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes were puniſht, and from whence comes it, that it could not ſtand with his majeſt: affaires te recall Parliaments, when his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> deſired to continue nothing, but what was neceſſary for the Kingdome?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having brought by theis irregular courſes the peoples intereſt, and his owne to ſo direct an oppoſition, that he might foreſee plainely, if nothing, but a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95058:41"/>Parliament could ſave the people, it muſt neceſſarily be his vndoing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King had no intereſt, but that, which was common to the people with him, and nothing, that was their intereſt could be oppoſite to his. The people were very farr from any ſuch apprehenſions of being <hi>Deſtroyed,</hi> or that they might not be ſaved without the <hi>Kings vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing;</hi> And wherein could the King foreſee his vndoing by Parliament, muſt he neceſſarily foreſee, that a Parliament would follow Traytours againſt him? Or muſt he neceſſarily foreſee that a Parliament would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake an illegall, and vn juſt power? Muſt he neceſſarily foreſee, that a Parliament would produce a Rebellion, when no Action was deſired to be continued by him, which was not according to law, nor any greivance duely proved vnredreſſed? But becauſe in the Parliament, which he called a faction deſtroyed him, and hath vndone the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, therefore Iconoclaſtes would have it plainely to be foreſeene. Such, as know the difference of the laſt from former Parliaments, know likewiſe, that it was not from the condition of the Parliament, but the conjuncture of affaires at the time of calling it, that produced thoſe wicked effects filling the mindes of many with ambitious thoughts, and deſire to lay the foundation of their private greatenes in the publique ruines. It is impoſſible, that the <hi>intereſt</hi> of a King can have an oppoſition to that of his <hi>people</hi> which is vainely fancied by him, or that any thing by him alledged ſhould worke ſuch oppoſition. And although there have been diſputes in Courts, and Parliaments touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the profitts, and rights of the Crowne, yet before this Rebell ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, non were ſo ſhameles to pretend them cauſes of the ſubjects violence, and neceſſarily deſturctive to the King, or people, which had the people imagined would have been the iſſue of a Parliament, they would have had a greater averſion to it, then Iconoclaſtes ſuppoſes in his late Mejeſt: And as the preſervation of the people is the Kings, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> ſo his preſervation is theirs, which the people now finde to late, and could not foreſee, that ſuch, as made vſe of the pretence of their intereſt, minded it leaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Till eight, or nine yeares after proceeding with a high hand in theſe enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; having the ſecond time levied an injurious warr against his native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Scotland, and finding all thoſe other ſhifts of rayſing money, which bore out his firſt expedition now to faile him, not of his own choice, and inclination, as any childe may ſee, but vrged by ſtrong neceſſities, and the very pangs of State which his owne violent proceedings had brought him to, he calls a Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Iconoclaſtes is very induſtrious to ſhew, that he can expreſſe the malice of his heart with his pen, and can give falſe denominations to Actions with greater confidence, then true, where it may advantag his Maſters. The gentle hand wherewith his Majeſt governed during the nine yeares he mentions, brands that high hand of ſlander, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, which this breaker ſtretches out againſt him, and it will fill
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95058:41"/>poſteritie with amazement at the folly of the preſent age, that ſhould take ſuch things for enormities, as <hi>fines for knighthood, Coate, conduct, and ſhipmony,</hi> whereof ſome of them were ſcarce felt, or obſerved, and the reſt eaſily borne; And ſubmit themſelves to <hi>contributions, exciſes, loanes, and taxes,</hi> to which thoſe, which he calls <hi>enormities</hi> hold no proportion. But not contented with the falſe appellations of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Civill Actions, he proceedes to defy, and reproach his Actions for preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and defence of his Kingdome, and calls it an injurious warr to reſiſt an invading Enemy. That the Scotts were entred neere a hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mile into the Kingdome, at the time he mentions, he cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and to call the warr injurious on his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> part cannot come from any, that thinkes any thing injurious, that Rebells commit, or any thing juſt that Governours command. When <hi>any</hi> Actions are rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> againſt the Scotts, the Traytours call them vnjuſt, and amplifie their ſlander with the Circumſtance of his native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. When the Scotts offer obedience to the King, or he concurr with them, they decry ſuch Actions, in reſpect they are of his native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, thus ſhifting, ſaying, and gainſaying to deceive the people. If there any yet remaine, that will truſt ſuch common Cheates. His col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, that <hi>neceſſitie,</hi> and not choice brought the King to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment followes not from any of his premiſſes. His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>neceſſitie,</hi> of his affaires from moving him to call the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: When he ſayes, that <hi>he called the Parliament not more by neceſſitie,</hi> then his owne choice, doth he exclude <hi>neceſſitie,</hi> or affirme his owne choice only without conſideration of Circumſtances. Parliaments ought not to be called, but vpon greate occaſions, and their too often Convention is a burthen, not an eaſe to the people, and ſuch was the judgment of the late Parliament at the beginning. It is not new, that <hi>neceſſities,</hi> have cauſed Kings to call Parliaments, which yet was never made an Argument to prove their owne vninclina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His deſcant vpon <hi>ſtrong neceſſities, and pangs of ſtate</hi> layes open the Treaſon of theſe conſpiratours, that plotted how their Country might pine, and languiſh, that ſo vnnaturall Emperickes might excerciſe their bloody practice, and a mercileſſe Tyrany could only be exſpected from ſuch; as ſought their power by their Countreyes ſufferings: And if his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> proceedings had been violent, they had not produced that neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt in Ireland, which only was to give him four ſubſidies, and ſo to expire, then in England, where his firſt demaund was but twelue ſubſidies to maintaine a Scotch warr condemned, and abominated by the whole Kingdome, promiſing their greivances ſhould be conſidered afterwards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament in Ireland he might have knowne was not the firſt, that was, called in the nine yeares he mentions, but falſ hood are ſo common, that miſtakes are not worth the obſervation, and if the King
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95058:42"/>had called that Parliament <hi>in Ireland</hi> to obtaine fower ſubſidies, where had been the fault? May not a King call a Parliament to be ſupplyed? But if Iconoclaſtes had patience to know truth, or ſpeake it, he might eaſily have found a greate number of good lawes made in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to worke a conformitie of that nation to England, and he vnſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably produced this inſtance of the Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which ſo mainely contradicts his aſſertion, for the neceſſities alone he ſuppoſes could not worke the calling of that Parliament, where Parliaments had been ſo frequent before. <hi>In England, where</hi> he ſayes <hi>his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund was, but twelue ſubſidies,</hi> he hath loſt his expectation, and his Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall <hi>but</hi> hath loſt its mirth for he cannot thinke, that the people now apprehend twelue ſubſidies ſo greate a demaund by the King, when they ſee a farr greater proportion given the Scotch for invading the Kingdome, and after ſuch an execrable warr and barbarous prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie their greivance is increaſt, and all, that is effected, or pretended to be done for them is the Deſtruction of King, and Church, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Eſtates of both among the Maſter Rebells, vpon whoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and vnlimited power they muſt now depend. That theſe <hi>twe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue ſubſidies</hi> were demaunded to maintaine Scotch warr hath no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of truth, it being not at al propounded; And as it had been a ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, and perverſe diſpoſition to have condemned the warr againſt the Scotts, when they were in preparation to invade England, ſo it is as ſhameleſly ſaid by Iconoclaſtes, that it was <hi>condemned and abominated by the whole people.</hi> Himſelfe if a wicked obduration had not made him love lying, muſt have conffeſſed, that the late Earle of Eſſex, though afterward in Rebellion againſt the King, with greate demonſtrations of Zeale, and affection to his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> went a Commaunder in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; And if we reſpect the qualitie, or number of noble, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons that engaged themſelves in that firſt warr, our ſtories have rarely remembred an Army, that went into Scotland of greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of eminent perſons, ſo as Iconoclaſtes hath juſt cauſe to condemne, and abominate himſelfe for the Lewdenes, and evidence of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, and if the then Parliament had not been abuſed by ſome repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> deſires, the deſignes of ſuch, as meant to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the breach of that Parliament had been diſappointed, and the Calamities enſuing had been prevented; And as there were no greivances then in the Kingdome, but might admit longer delay of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe, then the publique neceſſities of ſupply, ſo his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demaund ſubſidies in the firſt place with promiſe to redreſſe their greivances afterwards; And Iconoclaſtes too late obſerves the order of that demaund of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> to be amiſſe, when the late Parliament graunted ſo many ſubſidies for the Scotts without expectation of any ſuch promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which when the Parliament, who judged that warr it ſelfe on of their maine
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95058:42"/>greivances, made no haſte to graunt, not enduring the delay of his impatient will, or els fearing the conditions of their graunt, he breakes of the whole ſeſſion and diſmiſſes them, and their greivances with ſcorne and fruſtration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Parliament judged that <hi>warr</hi> any of their <hi>greivances,</hi> that never mentioned it in their debates, or reſolutions is fit for the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Author only. But if the Parliament had judged that warr one of their maine greivances, the reſt, whereof ſo greate noyſe hath been made, will hardly be thought weightie. This warr was then new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begun, the King had received no ſupply from the people for the charge paſt, and could this be a maine greivance? Wee ſee at what rate this man makes greivance, and to what ordinary accidents he applies his exorbitant expreſſions. The then Parliament would not have been ſlow in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ſupply, if ſome falſe Miniſters had not interpoſed, and ſome ſeditious perſons had not plotted to impoſe a neceſſitie vpon his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> to diſſolue the Parliament. They had not preſented him any <hi>greivances</hi> and therefore there could be no ſuch <hi>diſmiſſion with ſcorne and fruſtration,</hi> and he Phraſes it. There were evident tokens of greife, and diſcontent in his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> that he was neceſſitated to that act, but there was reioycing, and inſolence amongſt the turbulent Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Much leſſe therefore did he call this laſt Parliament by his owne choice, and inclination, but having firſt tryed in vaine all vndue wayes to procure mony, his Army of their owne accord being beaten in the north, the Lords petitioning; and the generall voyce of the people all moſt hiſſing him, and his ill acted Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Stage, compelled, at length both by his want, and by his feares, vpon meere extreamitie he ſummoned this laſt Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This man acts the part of a Lord of miſrule to ſtirre the paſſions of the people with taunts, and abuſes, and for his over acted petulant ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilitie fitt to be whipped of the ſtage. If he had ever given proofe of his owne courage, hee would not thus barbarouſly reproach his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſt: with feares, who was ſo well knowne to have hazarded his perſon in ſo many perills, and theſe Phraſes are the froth of a baſe inſultation, not the cenſure of a juſt Ennemy. But why for feare ſhould the King ſummon a Parliament if he fore ſaw, as the libeller ſayes it would be his vndoing: Could he have greater feares, then that? He hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced one vndue way of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> to get money for the warr againſt Scotland, &amp; therefore his repetitions import his impertinence, as well, as his malice but gaine no credit by their frequency. <hi>The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hiſſing,</hi> which the Traytours deſired, had been as inconſiderable, and vndutifull, as his aſſertions are falſe, but as it no way contradicts, what his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ſayes, if the allaying of popular diſcontents, &amp; recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying miſtakes were one end of calling the Parliament, ſo <hi>the petitioning of the Lords</hi> inſtructs all reaſonable men to thinke, that <hi>feares and wants</hi> were not the <hi>ſole cauſe</hi> of ſummoning that Parliament and that his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſt:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95058:43"/>choice</hi> was not excluded. And as the <hi>beating of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Army</hi> had not ſo diſabled him, but that they were in number, and courage ſuperiour to their Enemies, ſo if his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> 
                  <hi>choice</hi> had not guided him, he might with leſſe hazard in common appearance have tryed the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of a battell at that time; then he did at diverſe tymes afterwards. That, which he ſayes of the Armyes, being beaten of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord is little to their honour, if it were true, but infamous to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor being falſe, &amp; if there were any ſo perfidious to betray their own, and their nations honour vnto ſtrangers, they could not be many, for its a knowne truth, that the moſt eminent perſons in that ſervice, and the greateſt number of common ſouldiers ſerved his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> afterward in his warrs, not only againſt the Engliſh Rebells, but the Scotts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And how is it poſſible, that be ſhould willingly incline to Parliaments, who never was perceived to call them, but for the greedy hopes of a whole nationall bribe, his ſubſidies, and never loved, never fulfilled, never promoted the true ends of Parliaments, the redreſſe of greivances, but ſtill putt them of, and prolonged them, whether, gratifyed, or not gratifyed, and was indeede the Author of all thoſe greivances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been already ſhewed, how his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> was perceived to call Parliaments out of his owne choice, and inclination, and it was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> time, but in the time of Queene Eliſabeth, that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments were ſaid to be only called to give ſubſidies, there never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting male contents, and ſlanderers of the Actions of Princes, and the caſe may be ſuch, that ſubſidies may be the cheife motive, to call Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, conſidering the ſufficiency of the lawes in force, and the ſmall number of greivances complained of. Malitious detraction is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with abſurditie, and Iconoclaſtes becoming a Champion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion reckons Tributes, and ſupplies of the ſoveraigne by ſubjects, which is their duty among the number of ſcandalous ſins, and that which was practiſed by our ſaviour, and commaunded by his Apoſtles he calls nationall bribes. This braine ſicke, and prophane Libelling can be acceptable to none, but ſuch, as are delighted with the vnhappy diſtempers of Bedlam. He hath not ſo much paſſion to have greivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces redreſt, as love to the word, becauſe, as he thinkes, it imports mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpleaſing to the people, who yet are now ſatisfied, that thoſe, which abuſed them by the frequent vſe of the word greivances, never intended the remedy, but by multiplying complaints ſought to leade them into diſcontents againſt the Government, whereby they might become Captive to ambitious vſurpers. That, which he ſayeth is the true end of Parliaments <hi>to reforme greivances</hi> juſtly condemnes thoſe, he now calls a Parliament, who, he well knowes ſitt to no other end, but to encreaſe greivances, and in eight yeares time never redreſſed one. Though Kings take notice of greivances in Parliament, and take, order to redreſſe them, yet that cannot be called the true end of calling Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95058:43"/>for there are often occaſions of calling Parliaments in reſpect of publique ſafetie againſt Enemies, and conſpiratours, addition, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of lawes, publique ſupplyes, the <hi>redreſſe of greivances</hi> is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall to the Parliament, and the pretence of greivances hath proved the greateſt greivance, that ever the people ſuffered, and his ſcurrilous objection of <hi>greedy hope</hi> to his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> on whome malice it ſelfe hath not yet layd ſuch a Cryme encreaſeth the Libellers infamy, not the weight of his charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſay therefore, that he called this Parliament of his owne choice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination argues how little truth, wee can expect from the ſequell of this booke, which ventures in the very firſt period to affront more, then one nation, with an vntruth ſo remarkeable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>venturing</hi> vpon an <hi>vntruth</hi> in the <hi>first period</hi> be an argument to expect little in the ſequell of the booke, what may we expect of this Author, whoſe whole booke is a confutation of his <hi>firſt period,</hi> not to deſcant on the Kings miſfortunes? That in ſeeking to diſprove this firſt period adventured on ſo many palpable vntruths, and ſtickes not to pervert the very period it ſelfe, and affront not only more, then one nation, but all indifferent men? For if his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> had been neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either through the diſorder of perſons to diſſolve Parliaments, or for beare them, he might yet call a Parliament by his owne choice, conſidering, that not the condition of Parliament, but the malevolence of ſome perſons were cauſe both of the diſſolution, &amp; forbearance. The often Parliaments in Ireland, &amp; the precedent Parliaments in England to that, which he mentions, maintaine the truth of that <hi>firſt period</hi> againſt the many remarkcable falſities of this Image breaker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And preſumes a more implicit faith in the people of England, then the Pope ever commaunded from the Romiſh laitie, or els a naturall ſottiſhnes fitt to be abuſed, and ridden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Kings may expect credit to their words from their people, Rebells cannot though experience hath confirmed that if a greate part of the people of England had not followed them with a more <hi>blinde,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate <hi>beleife,</hi> then ever <hi>Romiſh laitie</hi> did their Pope, they could never have been ridden, and jaded, as now they are. And Iconoclaſtes could never preſume the beleife of his extravagant aſſertions, if he thought not his readers of worſe, then <hi>naturall ſottiſhnes to be abuſed,</hi> for while they lye groveling vnder the Tyrany of their preſent oppreſſours, and lament the loſſe of their happines vnder the Kingly Government, this man will perſwade them out of their ſenſe, and memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>While in the judgment of wiſemen by laying the foundation of his defence on the avouchment of that, which is ſo manifeſtly vntrue, he hath given a worſe foyle to his own cauſe, then when his whole forces were at any time overthrowne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely there wiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhewed as little reaſon, in judging an aſſertion, as knowledge in military affaires, that made by compariſon of this period to the defeat of an army. If his Maj: have <hi>given ſo greate a foyle to his cauſe</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:95058:44"/>by the firſt period of his booke whence comes the danger, that Iconoclaſtes would prevent? Was this firſt period vnintelligible without his comment, and what is it to the Kings, cauſe, whether he called the Parliament of his owne choice, or not. Its very likely his <hi>wife men</hi> heere are the ſame with his <hi>wel principled men</hi> he mentioned els where, &amp; their principles, or impiety being the ſame with his, their judgment is as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, as their conſcience, and as farr from wiſedome, as the libeller from modeſtie, and if any had ſuch a judgment, they might ſoone finde their errour, which all others deſcerne, and ſuch a judgment were a greater foyle to their wiſedome, then to his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They therefore, who thinke ſuch greate ſervice done to the Kings affaires in publiſhing this booke will finde themſelves in the end mistaken, of ſenſe, &amp; right minde, or but any mediocritie of knowledge, and remembrance hath not quite forſaken men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They will finde themſelves no whit miſtaken if <hi>ſenſe, right minde,</hi> and <hi>mediocritie of knowledge,</hi> and remenbrance have not quite forſaken men, but the libeller, will finde himſelfe very much miſtaken, if he expect, that his ſenſe ſhalbe ſo received againſt apparent truth, as to give a greater foyle, then the defeate of Arimes, and vnderſtanding muſt have left the world, where the Author of ſuch a compariſon findes credit.</p>
               <p>He comes now to proſecute his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> diſcourſe in purſucance of that period, and firſt to what his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> affirmes of Parliaments <hi>to have allwayes thought the right way of them moſt ſafe to his Crowne, and beſt pleaſing to his people,</hi> he ſayes we felt from his Actions what he thought of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, or of pleaſing his people.</p>
               <p>The people feele now, that, which makes them confeſſe, that they had juſt cauſe by what they felt from his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Actions to be well pleaſed with them, &amp; to beleive, what he affirmes heere to be his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Parliaments, and if any people were pleaſed with the ill way of Parliaments, they have ſeene their errour by the evill conſequents, and now thinke the <hi>right way of them only moſt ſafe for the Crowne, &amp; them,</hi> and that nothing, but ruine to the Kingdome can be expected from diſorderly Parliaments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He goes on to that, which his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> adds, that the cauſe of forbearing to Conveene Parliaments was the ſparkes, which ſome mens diſtempers there ſtudied to kindle.</hi> To this the libeller ſayes, <hi>they were not temperd to his temper, for it neither was the law, nor Rule, by which all other tempers were to be tryed, but they were choſen for fitteſt men in their Counties to quench thoſe diſtempers, which his inordinate doings had inflamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is the choice in Counties the law, and rule whereby tempers are to be tryed? And would the libeller have it beleived, that all ſuch, as are choſen in the Counties, are of better <hi>temper,</hi> then the King. If choice be the <hi>law of temper,</hi> why doth he juſtifie thoſe men, which have affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſcorn'd, and puniſhed ſuch, as have been choſen by the Counties?
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95058:44"/>If all are ſo well <hi>temperds,</hi> why are ſome ſo ill handled, and excluded? And if there may be diſtempers, as he muſt confeſſe in deſpight of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, why was it not a juſt reaſon of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> forebearance, if he found it? We know what fires ſmall ſparkes kindle in greate Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and we have felt the flame of them like the ſudden eruption of burning Mountaines, when all was quiet, and there were men, that ſtudyed to turne the Parliament into confuſion having not the temper to quench, but to enflame.</p>
               <p>Were theſe men, that were of the two Parliaments in the firſt yeare of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Raigne; The firſt called within two moneths after he begun, the ſecond within twelue, <hi>choſen to allay thoſe diſtempers, which his inordinate doings had inflamed,</hi> what were theſe <hi>inordinate doings, that could inflame</hi> ſo ſuddenly? We neede not argue this Authors credit from one vntruth, but he would obtaine ſome credit, if one entire truth could be found in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If that were his refuſing to conveene till thoſe men had been quallified to his will, wee may eaſily conjecture what hope there was of Parliaments, had not feare, and his inſatiate povertie in the middeſt of his exceſſive wealth conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> might with reaſon exſpect, that many, who through errour had cauſed diſtempers, might returne to a right minde ſeeing his temper, and their little reaſon to deſire ſuch Parliaments, as make it their whole worke to divide the peoples affections from the King, and follow the Councells of ſuch, as are malecontents for want of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, and if men had been quallified to his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> will, Parliaments would have had happier? ſucceſſe, and the people pleaſed with their agreement, that now groane vnder the miſeries of their diviſion. But whence his inſatiate povertie in the middeſt of his exceſſive wealth ſhould conſtraine him is not vnderſtood, wants, and wealth are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent. This libeller hath greate povertie of ſenſe in the middeſt of his exceſſive expreſſions. He goes an ill way to prove that the King was ſo vninclined to Parliaments, and that povertie compelled him, if he had wealth certainly that would have kept him from hazarding a courſe ſo diſliked. He ſhalbe rich, and poore, that ſome may contemne his povertie, others may grudge his wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King hoped by his Freedome, and their moderation to prevent miſvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings.</hi> To this ſayes Iconoclaſtes, <hi>wherefore not by their Freedome, and his moderation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Champion cannot fuffer a King to paſſe without ſignifying to him, that there is no difference betweene King, and ſubject. The King had reſolved to vſe <hi>Freedome</hi> in his conceſſions, and hoped they would vſe <hi>moderation</hi> in their demaunds. This man would have him ſay, that they ſhould vſe <hi>Freedome</hi> in their demaunds &amp; he would vſe <hi>moderation</hi> in his conceſſions, hath he not made it a proper ſpeech? Will his <hi>wiſe,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95058:45"/>and well principled men</hi> thinke him a fit Champion to breake Bell, &amp; the Dragon? But he gives a reaſon, why the King would ſpeake ſenſe, for <hi>he thought</hi> ſayes he <hi>Freedome to high a word for them, and moderation toe meane for himſelfe,</hi> and he concludes, <hi>this was not the way to prevent miſvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> Its ſure this man tooke the way to make miſvnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that would have <hi>Freedome</hi> applyed to the people, what ever the ſubject be, that is ſpoken of, and its like he would be well pleaſed, that they had <hi>Freedome</hi> from law, proſperitie, loyaltie, and obedience, which might be as well ſpoken, as the ſenſe he hath framed to prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnderſtandings.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>the King ſtill feared paſſion, and prejudice in other men, not in himſelfe, and doubted not by the weight of his owne reaſon to counterpoiſe any faction, it being ſo eaſie for him, and ſo frequent to call his obſtinacie reaſon, and other mens reaſon faction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had greate reaſon to feare paſſion, and prejudice in others, which he had ſo often tryed, and which they, that then feared not have ſince found true, and the conceſſions the King purpoſed, and performed might make him confident to counterpoyſe any faction, but the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler will have it beleived, that he, which graunted more, then any of his Predeceſſours was obſtinate, and they, that demaunded what former Parliaments thought vnreaſonable, and impious, had reaſon. But the King was deceived, that had to doe with Monſters, not reaſonable men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We in the meane while muſt beleive, that wiſedome, and all reaſon came to him by Title with his Crowne: Paſſion, prejudice, and faction to others by being ſubjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Kings have advantages above others for wiſedome, and reaſon, they are aſſiſted with diverſe Councells, and in publique affaires reaſon muſt be preſumed in Kings, and faction feared in ſubjects, nature being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to ſubmit, and intereſts, and partialities incident to all greate Aſſemblyes, and the detraction from the wiſedome of Rulers in the Rebells foundation, and a ſure ſigne of corrupt intentions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was ſorry to heare with what popular heate elections were carryed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places.</hi> To theſe words of the Kings he ſayes <hi>ſorry rather, that Court, letter, and intimations prevailed no more to divert, or to deterre the people from their free election of thoſe men, whome they thought beſt affected to Religion, &amp; their Countryes libertie, both at that time in danger to be loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were in danger to be loſt by a Trayterous conſpiracie with an invading enemy, but no other danger imaginable to any. There was never leſſe cauſe to complaine of Court letters, and intimations, nor ever greater miſtakes of perſons choſen, the Countryes affections to Religion, and libertie making way for the inſinuations of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſeducers, and had the Countryes knowne the diſpoſitions of the men they choſe, as their Actions have ſince diſcovered, they would not have truſted them with their Religion, and libertie, which they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95058:45"/>have betrayed. This Image breaker declaimes againſt the violence, &amp; levitie of the people, and heere calumniates his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> for obſerving the popular heate, whereby elections were carryed in ſome places, it being a moſt knowne truth, that popular, heate is as frequent vpon ſuch occaſions, as any other, witnes the long annimoſities between families, and the greate contentions, that ariſe from ſuch Elections.</p>
               <p>Among the many clamours in the late Parliament, where malice was as buſie, as this Author is now to finde out Court letters to divert, or deterre the people from free Elections, there was not one inſtance produced of ſuch <hi>letters or intimations.</hi> How wickedly induſtrious many were to blow abroade jealoſie, &amp; ſuſpition of the danger of Religion, &amp; libertie, &amp; how cauſeleſſely the people in many places were drawne into paſſion by vaine ſurmiſes, is too well knowne, and it is too late, for the Image breaker to ſeeke to reduce the people into thoſe miſopini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they have detected by too deare bought experience, for they well ſee, that there was no way ſo certaine to endanger Religion, and libertie, as they were ſeduced into, vpon pretence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſuch men they were, as by the Kingdome were ſent to adviſe him, not ſent to be Cavilled at, becauſe elected, or to be entertained by him with an vndervalue, and miſpriſion of their temper, judgment, or affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though ſuch, as were elected, were not ſent by the Kingdome, but by the reſpective places, one not intermedding with another, yet if Iconoclaſtes had not been more forward to expreſſe his impotencie, then warry in producing reaſon, he would not have ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of being Cavilled at, whereof he had not montioned the leaſt colour, and if he hold the perſons of men elected ſo ſacred, &amp; the King faultie for not eſteeming them, as he ought, what is the reaſon, that he defends the Tumults, that reproacht, and aſſaulted them? What is the reaſon he profeſſes ſo much honour to thoſe Maſters, that plucked them out of the houſe, &amp; kicked them into priſons? Kings ſend for their ſubjects to adviſe with them, and Iconoclaſtes might finde by the Elections of members of the lower houſe, that they were ſent to doe, &amp; conſent to ſuch things, as ſhould be ordained with the common Councell of the Kingdome, and therefore miſtakes their directions, that ſayes they were ſent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him, &amp; with what childish levitie doth he inſult on his ſoveraigne, for vndervaluing of the <hi>temper,</hi> judgment, or affection of perſons cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, as if their Elections re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>In vaine was a Parliament thought fitteſt, by the knowne lawes of our nation to adviſe, and regulate vnruly Kings, if they inſteede of hearkning to advice, ſhould be permitted to turne it of, and refuſe it by vilifying, and traducing their adviſers, or by accuſing of a popular heate, thoſe that lawfully elected them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If a Parliament were thought fitteſt by the knowne lawes of our Kingdome,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95058:46"/>to regulate vnruly King,</hi> it was certainly <hi>in vaine,</hi> for ſuch Kings, as ſtories report moſtirregular, were leaſt <hi>regulated</hi> by Parliaments, but on the contrary the Parliaments concurd to their deſires, and in ſuch extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Actions, as were the greateſt blemishes of their Government, &amp; Iconoclaſtes doth well to make a ſuppoſition of <hi>knowne lawes;</hi> for he knowes not any, that thought his ſuppoſition true, for the knowne, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes will not ſuppoſe an <hi>vnruly King,</hi> and therefore cannot thinke, of a way to <hi>regulate</hi> what they will not ſuppoſe, but were it ſuppoſed, that a Parliament were the <hi>fitteſt way toregulate</hi> vnruly Kings, doth it follow, that there wilbe no <hi>heate in elections,</hi> nor noe miſadvice in perſons elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Muſt the King take all for truth, and reaſon, that any of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſers will tell him? Or is a Major part of them ſo infallible, as the whole Kingdome muſt ſtand, or perish by the advantage of a few voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; perhaps one onely? But this breaker hath broken out into this vnnaturall heate, vpon the alone mention of <hi>heate in Elections,</hi> a matter not only of poſſibilitie, but knowne truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His owne, &amp; his Childrens intereſt oblidged him to ſeeke, &amp; preſerve the love, and welfare of his ſubjects.</hi> To this of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> he ſayes. <hi>Who doubts it, but the ſame intereſt common to all Kings, was never yet availeable to make them all ſeeke that, which was indeede beſt for themſelves, &amp; their poſteritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if it be <hi>the intereſt</hi> of Kings to preſerve the love, and welfare of their ſubjects, in vaine doth Iconoclaſtes from the tranſgreſſions of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons defame the ſacred office of Kings, and endeavour to ſet vp vſurpers, whoſe <hi>interest</hi> cannot ſo much oblidge them to the love, &amp; welfare of the people. He ſayes all men are oblidged by their <hi>intereſt</hi> to <hi>honestie,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice, but that conſideration workes litle in private men.</hi> It ſeemes by his writing, it workes litle in him, that ſo litle regards <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice.</hi> But his <hi>interest</hi> is not to regard it, for the <hi>interest</hi> of his profitt, and eſteeme with his Maſters cannot be maintained by <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> and that <hi>interest</hi> is more prevalent with him, then the <hi>interest</hi> of a good conſcience, or heaven it ſelfe. He might well have deſcerned, that his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> argued from the Humane, or Civill <hi>interest,</hi> which men are apt to judge ſtrongeſt, and the breaker impertinently diverts the ſenſe to talke of mens fayling in the exerciſe of vertue, when their temporall <hi>intereſts</hi> are the cauſe of their miſcarriage, and therefore his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> reaſon was ſtrong, that ſince his intereſt, as well, as right carried him to the inclination he mentioned, it might be more probable to others. But the Image breaker admits no reaſons, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves any, but magiſterially layes downe his poſition, <hi>that Kings have leſſe conſideration of honeſtie, &amp; Iuſtice then other men.</hi> It were an injury to that high calling to offer an anſweare to ſuch a barking detractour againſt the moſt approved, moſt ancient, and moſt ſacred office for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Humane ſocietie, that will deprave that, which God hath ſanctified, and will make thoſe, by whome God diſpenſeth the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95058:46"/>of peace vnto men, the greateſt Enemies to God, and goodnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He intended to oblidge both friends, &amp; Enemies, and to exceede their deſires, did they but pretend to any modest, and ſober ſenſe.</hi> To this he ſayes <hi>mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the whole buſines of a Parliament, which meete not to receive from him obligations, but Iuſtice, nor he to expect from them their modeſtie, but their grave advice vttered with Freedome in the publique cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This man miſtakes the whole buſines of a Parliament, that would exclude modeſtie from the advice, and libertie from the adviſed. The freedome, that the libeller intends is inconſiſtent with modeſtie, as-well, as Monarchy, Trayterous diſpoſitions having an Antipathy to morall vertues. How often have Parliaments made petitions to their King for graces, &amp; were they not oblidged, when they were graunted? But it cannot be expected, that ſuch, as deſpiſe dutie ſhould willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge the right of thoſe, to whome it belongs, and ſuch, as vſe no modeſtie will acknowledge no gratitude, or obligation. If their advice had been grave, their behaviour would have been modeſt, and they whoſe dutie was only to adviſe, had no pretence to Commaund, and dictate, nor they, that were to receive Juſtice from their King, to ſnatch what they deſired, and become judges of their owne demaunds. Such as wil not be oblidged by lawes, nor oaths cannot by benefites, &amp; favours, and ſuch, as have robbed a King of his power, grow quickely to that height of impudence to deny he had ever any, as this Author, that is ſo Brutish to affirme, that Kings cannot oblidge their ſubjects, &amp; thence it followes, that they owe no thankes to God for a good King, as they profeſſe to owe him none for his good Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His talke of modeſtie in their deſires of the common welfare argues him not much to have vnder ſtood, what he had to graunt, who miſconceived ſo much the nature of what they had to deſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His excepting at the talke of modeſtie ſhewes how little he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands other modeſtie, or the right, or practice of Parliament. Is not humilitie a word of larger ſignification, then modeſtie, and yet this breaker will make modeſtie contrary to the nature of the Parliaments deſires, and the Kings graunts, when humilitie is the common expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Parliaments petitions to the King. And he might well have ſaid the King vnderſtood not, what he had to graunt, if he had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected his ſubjects deſires to have a modeſt, and ſober ſenſe. Can there be deſires of the common-welfare, that exclude modeſt, &amp; ſober ſenſe? But the truth is the deſires of the late faction in the name of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had neither modeſt, nor ſober ſenſe, and thence the libeller would inferr it vnneceſſary, and it was very farr from the nature of what they had to deſire to demaund their Kings Crowne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for ſober ſenſe the expreſſion was too meane, and recoiles with as much diſhonour vpon himſelf fo to be a King, where ſober ſenſe could poſſible be ſo wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:95058:47"/>
               <p>And muſt it be the Kings diſhonour, if an Aſſembly of Parliament want ſober ſenſe, how does that recoile vpon him, can he make them otherwiſe? Iconoclaſtes lately reprehended his mention of heate in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, and now its the Kings diſhonour, if the Parliament want ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſenſe, was there never experience of a Parliament, that wanted ſober ſenſe, or was any man ſo ſavage, as to hold ſober ſenſe too meane for a greate Councell? Wee have ſeene not only ſober ſenſe, but al Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reaſon, law, &amp; Juſtice, wanting in a Parliament, being taken for the prevalent partie, and Hiſtories record it to have happened, more, then once. Kings have been vnhappy in ſuch Parliaments, but the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and infamy reſts vpon ſuch Aſſemblyes, and theſe Apologiſts are the Trumpetts of their ſhame, not the covers of their nakednes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The odium, and offences, which ſome mens rigour, or remiſſenes in Church, &amp; ſtate had contracted vpon his Government, he reſolved to have expiated with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lawes, and regulations.</hi> To this he ſayes <hi>the worſt miſdemneanours of rigour or remiſſenes he hath taken vpon himſelfe, as often as the Clergy, or any other of his Miniſters felt themſelves over-burthened with the peoples hatred. He inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the ſuperſtitious rigour of his ſundayes Chappell, remiſſenes of his ſundayes Theatre, that reverend ſtatute for Dominicall liggs, &amp; Maypoles derived from the Example of his Father Iames, which teſtifies, that all ſuperſtition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſenes in Religion iſſued from his authoritie, and the generall miſearriages in ſtate imputed cheifely to himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>remiſſenes and rigour</hi> of ſome men may contract <hi>odium,</hi> and <hi>offence</hi> in the beſt <hi>Governments</hi> was never doubted, but that this libeller would take occaſion from his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> intention to expiate them with better lawes, to caſt them on his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ſhewes that this Rebellion aroſe not from offences in Government, but wicked inclinations of ambition, &amp; Covetuouſnes, and that amendments were not deſired but confuſion. It was juſt, &amp; honourable, that the King ſhould take on him the defence of his lawes againſt Sectaries, and the protection of officers, in the exerciſe of juſt authoritie, againſt the hatred of frenitique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The hipocriſie of the ſchiſmaticall partie, that profeſſed greate tendernes of conſcience, and greife to ſee Children whipp a top on a ſunday, was ridiculous to al ſober men, yet theis are the motives to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyle a ſtate. That, which he calls the <hi>ſuperſtitious rigour of his ſundayes Chappell</hi> is noe other, then obſervation of the order of the Church of England, which none, but the Bedlam Browniſt ever called ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Chappell had nothing in the exerciſe of Devotion, but what the lawes of his Predeceſſours had appointed, and this muſt be his rigour. That, which he calls his ſundayes Theatre it ſeemes are recreations vpon ſundayes, and to that he prophanely, and ſcurrilouſly adds his Dominicall Jiggs. Can a Chriſtian, that hath reſpect to the day, make Dominicall the matter of his jeſt, but having abuſed ſacred titles to impious Actions, they proceede to ſcoffe with them. He inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95058:47"/>a booke publiſhed touching recreations, wherein his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> followed the example of his Royall father, and the advice of the moſt learned Divines. Judaiſme, and ridiculous ſuperſtition of the hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſectaries cheifely occaſioned that booke both in the time of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> and King James. Permiſſion of ſunday recreations is more agreeable to the doctrine, &amp; practice of other Churches, then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, &amp; the pretended tendernes of conſcience in the Sectaries, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares as falſe, as frivolous, and theſe Sectaries, that make this imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rigour, and remiſſenes a foundation to overthrow a Kingdome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low noe limits to their owne rigour, and remiſſenes, taking all libertie to themſelves, &amp; denying any to others. Why are theis doughty objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made againſt his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> when all know it touches not him parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly (if it were conſiderable) but his Father, &amp; queene Elizabeth, in whoſe times recreations of ſundayes were more practiſed, then in the time of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> &amp; by the way we may take notice of his ſcornefull appellation of his Father James. And for the miſcarriages in ſtate, wee may expect, that as the Actions will be by this Author vnfaithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſoe they will appeare of as litle weight for a ground to thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, which he frames vpon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> diſavowed none of theſe acts, till this Parliament, and heere ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to wipe of the envy of his evill Government vpon his ſubſtitutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> allwayes diſavowed illegall Acts, and whatever other mens rigour, or remiſſenes had contracted. And muſt a King ſatisfie the curioſitie, &amp; malice of all, that caſt envy on his Government? And was there ever a Parliament, wherein lawes were not made to expiate the odium contracted. When his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ſeekes to take away the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of evill in his ſubſtitutes, he deſerves the love, and thankes of his people, but it is the practice of Rebells to caſt the rigour, and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenes of the ſubſtitutes vpon the Government. His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ought not to beare the evill of other mens Actions, and his Government wilbe glorious to poſteritie, as it was happy to them, that enjoyed it in deſpight of envy, and this Author, and ſuch, as ſeeke to wipe of the guilt of this lewde Rebellion, by pretences of evill Government, which can noe more juſtifie their fact, then provocation a private Duell, ſufficiently cleere his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> of their reproaches by the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of theſe objections, and by offering vulgar envy, as a reaſon to deſtroy the Kingdome. He goes on jeering the Kings <hi>promiſes,</hi> for reforminge Religion, as <hi>too late,</hi> and becauſe popular confuſions had overtopt reaſon, therefore he concludes their Juſtice in working miſcheife, and breaking all the bonds of faith, and Religion. The purpoſes, which his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> had for reforminge Religion, could not by him be <hi>expreſſed artificiallie</hi> to gaine abatement of that violence, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he ſuffered, for they are noe other, then what he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten propoſed in the beginninge of the Parliament, and the workes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95058:48"/>of the dead King loſe not their weight, becauſe they declare to the world the vnjuſt vſurpation of his authoritie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All his vndertakings heeretofor declared him to have little, or no judgment in that worke of Religion.</hi> This libellers booke declares him to have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſcience of Religion, &amp; no wonder, if ſchiſmatickes are ſo ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in the contempt of the greateſt judgments, that differ from them, when they acknowledge the authoritie of no perſon over them, and that, which Iconoclaſtes pronounces-heere of the King, he will not ſticke to determine of all the world beſides, that agree not with his ſect. Sectaries are no leſſe inſolent, and cruell, then falſe, and fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, there being not any like exceſſe in ſuch, as attaine to higheſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments in Church, or ſtate by ordinary wayes, as in thoſe popular ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, preſumption being of more force, then truth with vulgar ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and thence this Champion of ſhiſmatickes not only vilifies his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> judgment in Religion, but tells the world, <hi>That his breeding, or courſe of life could not acquaint him with a thing ſo ſpirituall.</hi> The breeding, and courſe of life of this generation of ſectaries is not vnknowne, and they ſeeke to ſupply with impudence, what they want of abilitie. It were a fault to mention heere his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> parts, learning, and pietie, and the Scripture, which directs vs to try the ſpirits hath give vs ſuch markes of the falſe, and lying ſpirits, as wee ſhould be much wanting to ourſelves, if wee could not judge thoſe men, that are proud-boaſters, deſpiſers of Parents, deſpiſers of Dominion, Traytours, faith-breakers to be ſuch, as deſcerne not the things of the ſpirit, though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Wee know not the Miſteries of this mans Religion, otherwiſe we might demaund of him, why the King ſhould goe further, then his reaſon, and conſcience directed him and why the libeller, &amp; his Mates ſhould hould it lawfull for them to ſpurne at al lawes both in Church, and ſtate vpon pretence of their reaſon; and conſcience againſt them, he cannot deny to have done this, &amp; they ſhould doe well to ſhew, how the King may goe againſt his reaſon, &amp; conſcience. Is it intayled vpon him with his Fortune, as a King to have leſſe priviledge, then they? &amp; muſt he renounce his owne reaſon, and conſcience to the advice of a Parliament? And muſt they controll him, and the Parliament? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King muſt give an account to God for the Talents, he hath lent him. But how can the breaker conclude, from the Kings forbearance of Acts, wherein he is vnſatisfied in his conſcience, that is to ſet vp an Arbitrary Government when as nothing is introduced? And why muſt not all Brittaine be chained to the judgment, reaſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the King, as well, as all Iſraell, Gods owne peculiar people, and not only all Brittaine, but the whole world are Chained to the reaſon, judgment, and conſcience of their Rulers be they one, or many, And the ſeducers would perſwade vs, that Brittaine could not be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, vnles it were reduced to its ancyent barbaritie, and governed by a multitude of Kings, &amp; Religions. God had promiſed peculiar aſſiſtance to Kings, and Commaunds the peoples obedience to them, &amp; the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the Kingdome many be imputed in a greate part to what his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> obſerved, that he had ſuffered his owne judgment to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne in ſome things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Tyrant may make this pretence, and it were in vaine for any Parliament to have reaſon, judgment, or conſcience, if it thwarted the Kings will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It were much more tollerable for a Tyrant, to pretend conſcience in governing, then for a people to pretend conſcience in rebelling, and this libeller hath reprehended the peoples levitie, and violence ſo ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely, as he cannot if he pretend reaſon, ſubject the reaſon, judgment, and conſcience of the Rulers to the controll of the ſubjects. Becauſe Tyrants may pretend conſcience, therefore by good logicque no King may vſe it, and becauſe ſome Kings may not rightly governe, therefore he will have the right judgment in the people, which he ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes, and which, as it hath been the meanes of the Rebells preſent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, ſo it hath been in all ages the cauſe of confuſion, and miſerie to ſtates, and Kingdomes. The reaſon, judgment, and conſcience of a Parliament is not therefore in vaine, becauſe not infallible, it is moſt probable, that a King will follow the beſt Councell, but it cannot be preſumed that in Parliaments, the greater-part will continue ſubjects, if they may be Kings by ſaying they wilbe, and it was the wiſedome of our Anceſtours, that would have no lawes made without the will of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95058:49"/>their King, and they never truſted ſuch, as they choſe further, then to preſent their deſires, and offer their Councell vnto him, and conſent to what ſhould be ordeyned by him with advice of the Lords, &amp; it were in vaine to have a King, if he were not impowred to judge of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, or if lawes might be obtruded vpon him, and the people without him.

               <p>His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> expreſſions being thorowly ſifted containe nothing in them, but pious, and Princely conſiderations, and from libellers owne mouth all men may ſee, that his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> practices, againſt which they maliciouſly exclaime were conſonant to Religion, and Juſtice, and only oppoſite to Trayterous, and ſchiſmaticall licence. It was the libellers profeſſion to parrallell his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> faire ſpoken words, as he calls them to his owne farr different Actions, and now his words, and deedes being ſifted by malice it ſelfe are not much different, the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is ſome what ingenuous to diſcover his owne vanitie, and falſhood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He leaves it to prudent foreſight, what fruites in likelyhood his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorement would have produced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have ſeene already the fruites of the inhumane cruelties exerciſed vpon him, and the continuance, and encreaſe of thoſe abominable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, that attend ſuch Actions, where of the libeller makes a large profeſſion, who confidently obtrudes laviſh lyes, for knowne truths, petulant inſolence, for ſober ſenſe, &amp; maximes of villany, for ſound Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which are the bitter fruites of diſobedience, and Rebellion.</p>
               <p>To that part of the ſection, which he calls <hi>the devout of it, and model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the forme of a private Pſalter, he objects nothing,</hi> but his ſpleene, <hi>that it is not to be admired, more then the Arch-Biſhopps late Breviary, and other manualls, and handmaides of Devotion, and theſe he calls the lip worke of every Prelaticall leiturgiſt, quilted out of Scripture Phraſe, with as much eaſe, and as litle neede of Chriſtian diligence, or judgment, as belongs to the compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of any ordinary, &amp; ſaleable peece of Engliſh Divinitie, that the ſhopps value.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Authors of <hi>leiturgies,</hi> and helpes to devotion, have their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bleſſed by the benifit, which many devout ſoules have acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to have received from their labours, and the crueltie, which bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Rebells exerciſed on the perſon of the late Arch-biſhopp, and their other barbariſmes, towards the Prelates, to pleaſe that kennell by whome they acted their Rebellion, hath ſatiſfied the world of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95058:49"/>of Sectaries, of whoſe bloody diſpoſition, many by ſheepes-clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were much deceived. <hi>Quilting of Scripture Phraſe</hi> was wont, to be the prayſe of their long winded Lecturers, who vſed it more for ſound then ſenſe, but it ſeemes their ſpirit is changed. The libeller will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gett credit, vnles with thoſe, for whoſe ſake he doth not profeſſe to write, that is his wiſe, and well principled men the Sectaries, if he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that there is more neede of Chriſtian diligence in the bold, and extempore bablinge of their ſenſeles zealots, then the <hi>compiling of thoſe Leiturgies, and Manualls,</hi> he mentions. And ſuch, as have obſerved the preſumption of this rabble in their prayers, will beleive they hate dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as much, as they want judgment. Why Engliſh, or ſaleable ſhould dininiſh the eſteeme of Divinitie is not vnderſtood, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſed they are common termes, he would have his readers vnderſtand, that they ſignifie nothing, but common matter, and he expects, that ſome will thinke Engliſh, and ſaleable Divinitie of no regard, though they vnderſtand no other.</p>
               <p>But he proceedes ſuch a kinde of <hi>Pſalmaſtry, or other verball devotion, without ſuteable deedes, cannot perſwade any of Zeale, and righteouſnes in the perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuch, as make Pſalmaſtrie a word of contempt, reliſh not the Zeale of the ſweete ſinger of Iſraell, and their deedes are odious to all good men, that ſeeke matter of reproach vpon the devotions of others, and make their malitious ſurmiſes poſitive truths.

In his diſſembled profeſſions, holds noe proportion with, theis hipocriſies, really acted, not fancyed by a poet, and this libeller hath learnt to act a part out of ſhakeſpeare, and with Rich. 3. accuſing loyaltie, and innocency for high Crymes, and crying out againſt their wickednes, that ſought to reſtore the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeſſed heires of the Crowne to their right, and amplifying their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as the higheſt againſt God, and man, and wherein comes the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller ſhort of his patterne in this ſcene.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>heerein the worst of Kings profeſſing Chriſtianiſme have by farr exceeded him,</hi> and he gives his reaſon, <hi>for that the King hath, as it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed, and vnchriſtned by borrowing to a Chriſtian vſe prayers offred to a heathen God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And doth ſaint Paul exceede the worſt of Kings profeſſing Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme by borrowing to a Chriſtian vſe the words of an heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, and poet, did he thereby vnhallow, and vnchriſten Scripture?</p>
               <p>His meaning is, as followes afterward, that the King vſed a prayer taken out of S. Philip Sydnies Arcadia. After the firſt Edition of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> booke, the Printers finding the greate vent of them, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Editions Printed prayers, and other things in the Kings name, not belonging to the booke. Among theſe prayers, there is a prayer taken out of the Arcadia. That prayer is neither made by a heathen, woman, nor to a heathen God, but is compoſed by the Author a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian without reference to any heathen Deitie, and the Author is not thought to vnchriſten prayer by it, the libeller himſelfe ſaying the booke in its kinde is full of worth, and wit, but as his outcry hath noe cauſe from the matter, ſo heere is no evidence of the fact, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſt: made vſe of that prayer, or popt into the Biſhopps hands as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of his exerciſe, though he might warrantably have vſed it and profeſſed it.</p>
               <p>But he goes on to ſhew what he can ſay vpon this occaſion. <hi>Who would have imagined ſo little feare in him of the true alſeeing Deitie, ſo litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the holy Ghoſt, whoſe office is to dictate, and preſens our Chriſtian prayers, ſo litle care of truth in his last words, or honour to himſelfe, or to his friends, or ſenſe of his afflictions, or of that ſad hower, which was vpon him, as immediately before his death to pop into the hand of that grave Biſhopps, who attended him, as a ſpeciall relique of his ſaintly exerciſes a prayer ſtolne, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All men, that have obſerved this Authors practice hitherto reſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that he hath ſo litle feare, or reverence of the all ſeeing Deitie, ſo litle care of truth, or honour, as he ſtickes not to charge his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> with facts neverdone, and innocent Actions, with tranſcendent guilt. If his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> had vſed the prayer, or delivered it, as he imagines, no
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95058:50"/>man of Chriſtian ſobrietie could charge the fact with Cryme, what one word, or ſentence is there in that prayer, which a Chriſtian may not vſe, but the Image breaker hath a greate quarrel to al formes of prayer, and by the reaſon he produces, that the office of <hi>the holy Ghost is to dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and preſent our Chriſtian prayers,</hi> all ſet prayers want reverence to the holy Ghoſt, ſo tender is he of the beſt reformed Churchs, of whome he ſo often makes a propertie. And whence concludes he no care of truth in his laſt words, when the King never ſpake of it. He aggravates this fact by the perſon of the grave Biſhopp, who had been a Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call leiturgiſt, had it not been to paint a ſlander. The laughter, which he conceives is cauſed by the thought of this, <hi>that he, which acted ſo Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically ſhould have ſuch a ridiculous exit</hi> might rather ſtrike horrour in the libeller, for his malitious oppoſition to truth, that will ſo contrary to his owne knowledge charge him to act tragically, that had governed ſo mildly, and to have a ridiculous exit, that left the world with ſo greate pietie, and ſuch vniverſall greife of the people for his ſufferings, but deſperate wretches laugh at the wickednes they act. His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> friends have had good experience, that his Enemies, who have ſpared no paines to traduce him, would not for beare any occaſion of detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> enduring afflictions with admired patience, his fuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring death with Chriſtian fortitude, his vertuous life, &amp; holy Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, cannot be blaſted by an Atheiſts ſcorne, nor a Rebells malice.</p>
               <p>His concluſion in the begging of the queſtion, <hi>that it is cleere the King was not induced, but conſtrained to call the last Parliament,</hi> which by his owne ſhewing is apparently falſe, for if there had been ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, the Lords in vaine petitioned, and all the neceſſities, that he hath ſuppoſed may concurr with the Kings inclination to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if neceſſitie had conſtrained him to call a Parliament, what ſhould hinder, but <hi>he might avouch in the eares of God, that he did it with an vpright intention to his glory, and his peoples good.</hi> If neceſſitie of his peoples preſervation, or welfare cauſe him to call a Parliament, may he not vſe theſe words; Whence would the Image breaker have it a cauſe of trembling, more, then any thing ſpoken in the preſence of God. The permitting mans wickednes is no approbation of it, nor a token of his hatred to thoſe, that are afflicted by it. There are ſome, whome God hath given over to deluſion, and of that the libeller appeares to have a greate meaſure, who not only beleives lies, but is the Author of them, making the names of Religion, and conſcience, and the feare of God baites to deceive, and venom to reproach</p>

Arbitrary in the beginning of the late Parliament was vſed to ſcare the people, and made to ſignifie greate affrightments to them, but that bugbeare is now growne rediculous to children, for all men ſee, that in all places of Government much is left Arbitrary to the Governour, and it was evident to the world, that the Earle of ſtrafford did nothing in an Arbitrary manner, without Preſident of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, and the Judges in Courts of equitie, might be aſwell made Cryminall for proceeding in an Arbitrary manner as he. That he had endeavoured to ſubvert fundamentall lawes was a ſuppoſition, not a fact, and if the Image breaker looke over the Articles, where with he was charged at his Tryall, he will finde nothing of ſuch a Cryme. To <hi>ſubvert Parliaments, and incenſe the King, againſt them</hi> was not as much, as vrged againſt him as his Tryall, that Article being declined by his accuſers in regard of knowne falſhood, and that the Earle of ſtrafford adviſed the King, to call the former Parliament. <hi>That he had endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make hiſtolitie betweene England, and ſcotland</hi> was a legend deviſed for vulgar temper, not rationall conſideration, for both Kingdomes being vnder one King, they muſt be Rebells in either Kingdome, that make warr againſt one another without him, and what dreamer can fancy that any Miniſter of ſtate, that were affected to the Kings deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as this libeller ſuppoſes the Earle of ſtrafford to be, would ſtirr vp hoſtilitie betweene the nations. They have not yet adventured to charge the Earle of ſtrafford with ſtirring vp the ſcotch hoſtilitie, and if he endeavoured to reſiſt them, is that <hi>to make hoſtolitie be tweene the nations,</hi> It hath been the practice of theſe Rebells to ſtile men incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, and malignants, that oppoſed their Rebellion, and ſuch evill
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95058:52"/>Counſellours that adviſed any courſe to prevent their attemps, and the following confuſion but though this vaine deluſion were caſt abroade among the people, it was never offred, as a charge againſt the Earle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he had councelled the King, to call over that Iriſh Army of Papiſts, which be had ounningly rayſed to reduce England, as appeared by good Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony then preſent at the conſultation,</hi> is vnſeaſonably remembred by the libeller after thoſe Rebells, whome he ſerves, have ſeverall times drawne in forraigne Armies into England, reduced the nation to ſerve an vſurped power, ſet vp an Arbitrary Government, ſubverted the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall lawes, and deſtroyed both King, and Parliament. It may aſtoniſh Knowing men to reade this Author, objecting Capitall offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Earle of ſtrafford, and numbring vp for inſtance the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions himſelfe deſends: ſoe as it cannot be an humane errour, but hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-fury, that hurles him into ſuch mad contradictions, and its worth the obſerving, that to this particular he adds, as appeared by good Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony then preſent at the conſultation, well Knowing, that the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was not only ſingle, but ſubject to moſt juſt, and apparent excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in regard of knowne enmitie, and former prevarication in ſeverall examinations vpon oath, and it no way helpes a falſe Teſtimonie, that he knew the truth, or that he was preſent at a fact, whereof he makes an vntrue relation, and if the Earle of ſtrafford had councelled the King to make vſe of the Jriſh Army in either Kingdome in caſe of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, how comes that to be an offence, though that was not the truth, that he ſpake of England, nor the Army rayſed againſt England, and is it a commendable cunning, to rayſe an Army againſt a Rebellion.</p>
               <p>His reference to 28 <hi>Articles</hi> directs vs how to know? that he truſts on number more then weight, and thoſe Articles remaine a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to poſteritie of the ridiculous pretences which effected ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife. He ſayth <hi>the Commons by farr the greater number-caſt him,</hi> and yet is ſo abſurdly impudent to charge the King with ſingularitie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and alledge preſently a part of the lower-houſe of the ſame opinion. <hi>The Lords,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>after they had been ſatisfied in a full diſcourſe by the Kings ſolicitour, and the opinions of many Iudges delivered in their houſe agreed likewiſe to the ſentence of Treaſon.</hi> Thoſe Lords, that condemned the Earle of ſtrafford, might be ſatisfied by terrour of the Tumults, and their owne corrupt paſſions, never by law, nor reaſon. Its well knowne, that the Lords, and Commons were aſſaulted, and threatned by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly rabble of the Citie, and Suburbs, if they condemned him not, they had not freedome in their coming, or going to the houſe, or ſitting there. There was no one judge, that gave his opinion for the ſentence againſt him, and the Sollicitours diſcourſe was very ſtrong againſt the preſent Rebells, wholy impertinent to the caſe of the Earle of ſtrafford, and ſhewed his owne deceite, and the ſottiſhnes of them, that relyed on what they vnderſtood not. Diverſe lords for ſooke the houſe having
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95058:53"/>not libertie to be preſent, ſoe farr were the lords from being ſatiſfied. That which he calls a ſentence of Treaſon, was an act of power, it being a Bill to take away his life, but an exception of all men els, from being proceeded againſt for the ſame matters, in ordinary Juſtice, and this very Action, ſoe ſcandalous in it ſelfe, and ſoe greivous to many, that conſented to it, muſt be dreft out with a ſhameleſſe commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to accuſe the King, for his repentance of a fact, which ſoe much afflicted him. <hi>That the people vniverſally cryed for juſtice</hi> is noe wonder, if we conſider former examples, and the had a Preſident in the people of the Iewes, that cryed Crucifie. If we beleive this libeller, telling vs how light, and violent, they are in their motions, or if we looke vpon the acts of a powerfull faction, then prevayling with them, that could eaſily make them cry, what was put in their mouth, we may eaſily judge the injuſtice of their cry, and their ignorance of the cauſe, and a ſober author would have hated, to borrow an Argument of Juſtice, from popular outcryes, which are the moſt evident proofe of injuſtice, and oppreſſion of innocence.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>none were his friends, but Courtiers, and Clergimen, the worſt at that time, and moſt corrupted ſort of men, &amp; Court ladies, not the beſt of women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His fer friends, and many Enemies, render the proceedings againſt him more, then ſuſpected, and men may eaſily beleive, that in ſuch a condition furie was the accuſer, and malice, and cowardiſe the judge. The confining his friends to Court, and Church, is the effect of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers engagement of ſchiſme, and Rebellion, who holds ſuch loyaltie, and affection to the King, and conſcientious reverence to the Church, for the markes of greate offenders. If multitude of Ennemies be a Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of guilt, the beſt men will become the worſt of ſinners. But having noe friends, as he ſayes, it adds much to the right of his cauſe, that ſoe many who were neither Courtiers, nor Clergymen, nor any way obliged by him, or the Court, ſhould in diſcharge of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienc declare their diſſent to that bloody law, though they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by objected to popular fury. His impertinent rayling at Courtiers, and Clergymen argues his malice, not Cryme in them. His mention of Court ladies was for want of matter, and their activitie in ſtate affaires belongs not to this occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King declared to both houſes, that not feares, or reſpects what ſo ever, ſhould make him alter that reſolution, founded vpon his conſcience, and ſayes either then his reſolution, was not founded vpon his conſcience, or his conſcience recieved better information, or both ſtrucke ſayle, for within few dayes after, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his Biſhopps pickt the thorne out of his conſcience, and he was perſwaded to figne the Bill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men, that are ſincere often fall, but ſuch never have conſciencie, nor ſinceritie, that jeere at it, and make the falls of men, and their wounds of conſcience matter of their mirth. Though his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> did that,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95058:53"/>which he had formerly profeſſed to be againſt his conſcience, could he not repent of that frailetie of falling from his reſolution? Or might he not afterwards diſcover the errours of thoſe reaſons, that induced him to it? If feares were any motive to what he did, the curſe lies on them, that cauſed it, and on them, that reproach him with it. Poets have not fancied a higher degree of wickednes in fends of hel, then in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious glory of compelling others to ſin, and reproaching their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ſin. Experience hath repreſented his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> fortitude, and that not his perſonall feares, but his apprehenſion of the Kingdomes miſerie wrought moſt on his paſſion, and wee cannot finde Parallell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to thoſe of this libeller in his Scoffes at conſcience, and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the thorne out of it, vnles amongſt thoſe deſperate, and prophane Atheiſts, that make it the higheſt pitch of wit to render things ſacred moſt ridiculous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perhapps, it wrung his conſcience to condemne the Earle, not becauſe he thought him guiltles, had halfe theſe Crymes been committed against his perſonall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, as appeared by his charge againſt the ſix members, but becauſe he was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, and the Earle but acceſſory, and thought nothing Treaſon againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, but against himſelfe only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Playing with conſcience he cannot part with, whoſe owne is inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. In thoſe particulars he hath rehearſed againſt the Earle of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, no one of them could be charged vpon the King, and the nature of moſt of the Articles coud not admit a ſuppoſition of the Kings acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie in them. The charge againſt the ſix members conteyned matter of direct Treaſon againſt knowne lawes, &amp; his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to thinke the Earle of Strafford guiltie, becauſe he charged the ſix members, which ſome offences laid to the charge of the Earle of Strafford, but never proved, yet it was an infamous injuſtice of them that ſo violently proceeded againſt the Earle of Strafford, and would not admitt an accuſation for the ſame offences againſt others. If his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> thought, that noe Treaſon could be committed, but againſt himſelfe, he thought no otherwiſe then the law hath provided, &amp; the accuſers of the Earle of Strafford maintained at his Tryall. And the libeller muſt checke himſefle for his imagination of Treaſon againſt the Common wealth, which had not a being, vnles he will make a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by Propheſie, &amp; antedate his ordinance. He well knowes England was a Monarchy, and that his Maſters profeſſe the change of it into a ſuppoſed free ſtate. Their Traytours, that would imagine ſome Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the King are come to affirme, that there are no Treaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, for they are ſure they have committed all, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his perſon. His impertinency is very tedious in demaunding, why the King ſhould ſeeme ſatisfied to ſigne the Bill by thoſe <hi>Iudges, and Ghostly Fathers,</hi> as he calls them, <hi>of his owne chuſing, and now pretend, that it was the importunities of ſome, and feare of others made him ſigne.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:95058:54"/>
               <p>He does not produce any Teſtimony, that the King profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſatisfied, or had he been ſatisfied, it was no barr to his future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, &amp; repentance, but an inſtance can hardly be produced, that ever any mans repentance of a knowne fact was traduced, or ſcorn'd by any, before this libeller, &amp; he might aſwel jeere at many famous ſaints, and Martyrs, that fell from their reſolutions, and after recovered, as at his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> And <hi>the picking out of his thorne, ſtriking ſayle to his feare, and a fleeting conſcience,</hi> may vpon the ſame grounds be the moſt eminent penitents in the Church of God. To make his Calumnies ſticke, he ſayes. <hi>That his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> enſuing Actions declare he could diſſemble ſatisfaction, for that he had the cheife hand in a conſpiracie against the Parliament, and Kingdome.</hi> How the King could conſpire againſt his Kingdome, or what ſhould be his end is not intelligible, &amp; when a King is traduced by Rebells for a conſpiracy againſt the Parliament, and Kingdome, no men of common reaſon can receive ſuch a palpable fiction, but this greate conſpiracy, which he ſayes <hi>came to light by the examinations of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Goring, and others was to reſcue the Earle of Strafford by ſeizing the tower of Londen, to bring vp the Engliſh Army from the north, joynd with eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Iriſh Papiſts rayſ'd by Strafford, &amp; a french Army to be landed at Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth againſt the Parliament, and their friends.</hi> And where is the offence in all this, if it were true, and a powerfull faction aſſume the name of Parliament? No wiſe man will blame the King, if he had done ſuch an Action to prevent the miſeries, which he foreſaw, and the Deſignes, that were plotted againſt him, but this ſtory is now ſtale, though it then ſerved the turne to diſtemper the people. The examinations, which he ſpeakes of, doe not yet charge the King with the knowledge of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, but the readers of Iconoclaſtes muſt be of miraculous ſtupiditie, if they thinke it a Cryme in the King to intend the bringing vp of his Army from the north, or any other force, and thinke it lawfull for the Rebells againſt him to bring vp their Army againſt the Parliament, and plucke them out of the houſe. Was not the Tower of London all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the Kings poſſeſſion, and might he not make it good againſt Traytours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For which purpoſe</hi> he ſayes <hi>the King though requeſted by both houſes refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to disband thoſe Iriſh Papiſts.</hi> Though there were many reaſons, why his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> refuſed to disband the Iriſh, and the requeſt of the houſes were a vote conſtrained by Tumults, not the reſult of a free debate, yet had it been ſo, that his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> had refuſed to disband them to prevent the plots of the Trayterous faction in Parliament, he had juſt reaſon to doe it. And as the Religion men profeſſe, though true, doth not privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them from offending, though they are thereby a ſcandall to their profeſſion: So Iriſh Papiſts, or any others of contrary Religion may be imployed againſt ſuch, as have ſtained their profeſſion by ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe Rebels ſought ſhelter from their Religion for their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95058:54"/>&amp; perſwaded the people of their ſinceritie, becauſe Papiſts fought againſt them, but it was in truth their infamy, that gave the reaſon, and the frequent repetition of Iriſh Papiſts ſhewes, that it is a ſtale to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leade the weakeſt capacities, that can only ſuſpect, not prove, nor deſcerne.</p>
               <p>He concludes <hi>the King as Criminous, as the Earle,</hi> and therefore he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, <hi>inſteed of deteſting his ambition, evill Councell, violence, and oppreſſion of the people, he falls to prayſe his greate a bilities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It had been a Kinde of ſlander to forbeare the due commendation of ſuch abilities, as all men admired, and an vnexcuſable injuſtice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the memory of the innocent with the falſe accuſations of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Enemyes. If his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> had recounted any faults of the Earle, it had byn no ſatiſfaction to his conſcience for conſenting to his death, but it had been a ſigne of an vnſound minde to ſeeke matter of excuſe for an illegall ſentence from the diſpoſition of the ſuffering partie, and ſuch Actions, as the law had not made the merit of ſuch a ſentence. The world is well informed now, that thoſe Rebells account the due performance of juſt authoritie violence, and oppreſſion, and that their cheife hatred againſt the Earle of Strafford was for his fidelitie to king, and Kingdome, and his oppoſition of Rebellion his evill Councell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That beneath the decency of a King, he compares him to the ſun which in all figurative vſe beares alluſion to a King, not to a ſubject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ſuch be the Kingly Prerogative, that the ſun beares alluſion only to Kings, not to ſubjects, then muſt this libeller confeſſe himſelfe to be of that ſordid generation, which by that influence are rayſed out of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and puddles to obſcure that gloryous luſter, and his obſervation of this alluſion might juſtly make him reflect vpon himſelfe with deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation contending againſt ſuch cleere light, and ſlandring truth it ſelfe. But vertue in other perſons beſides Kings hath been ſet foorth by allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the ſun, and his triviall exception at the decency of that alluſion ſhewes him as inſignificant, as will full.</p>
               <p>He hath a conceite, that the <hi>King Knitts contradictions as cloſe, as words can lie togeather, not approving in his judgment, and yet approving in his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent reaſon, all that Stafford did, as driven by the neceſſitie of times, and the temper of that people</hi> The Kings words are, <hi>I cannot in my judgment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all he did, driven it may be by the neceſſitie of times</hi> &amp;c. And let the reader judge, whether this libellers falſification be not Knit, as cloſe, and words can lie togeather, and its like he knew it by his impertinent vſe of the Phraſe cloſe Knit to his ſuppoſed contradictions. Though the King juſtly excuſed ſome things, which he could not approve, doth he therefore approve all, and doth the libeller thinke, that what a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve, he muſt thinke inexcuſable, and that Circumſtances doe not alter the qualitie of Actions?</p>
               <p>But he ſayes <hi>it is the marvell, and may be the aſtoniſhment of all, that have
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95058:55"/>a conſcience, how he durſt with the ſame words of contrition, wherewith David repented the murthering of Vriah, repent his lawfull compliance to that juſt Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is noe marvell to men, that know theis Rebells, though heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it might have been the aſtoniſhment of all, that ſuch ſhould offer to perſwade others of their eſteeme of conſcience, that make it their common ſcoffe, and while this libeller, charges the King with no leſſe then murder in conſenting vnwillingly, and conſequently in him to an vnjuſt ſentence, makes an exclamation, why he ſhould repent in Davids words for the like Cryme. The libeller well knowes, that if it had been to a lawfull ſentence of condemnation, yet blood guiltines lies, where conſent with the tongue, had not the perſwaſion of the heart, &amp; when the King, thought blood lay on him, ſhould he thinke to hide his ſin from God? &amp; this prophane Sectary wonders a ſinner durſt repent. Theſe miſcreants are loath to behold their murders in thoſe bloody colours, which the truth of God gives them, &amp; therefore they wil call that Act juſt againſt the cry of their Conſciences, as they ſtirred vp the people to cry juſtice without knowledge of the fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It would have taken much from the heavines of his ſin to have told God in his confeſſion, how he laboured, what darke plots he had contrived, into what a League entred, and with what conſpiratours against his Parliament, &amp; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to reſcue ſo notable an inſtrument,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Doubtles the King would have taken that courſe, if he could have charg'd himſelfe with any ſinfull labour in that kinde. That he ought to have vſed all his power, and ſkill to have reſcued that Earle, was his dutie to God, and a perſon ſo cruelly, &amp; ſhameleſſely oppreſſed; And all men know what falſe feares were pretended, what ridiculous plots were imagined to diſorder the people, and when there is ſuch apparent diſcovery of Trayterous plots, and ſuch avowing of Trayterous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there can be none ſo infatuated to beleive, that all neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of ſuch wicked deſignes was not to withſtand the ruine of the Parliament, and Kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was feare, which made him fayne both the ſcruple, and the ſatiſfacttion.</hi> And what feare could make him fayne a ſcruple, whome could he feare, if he had not ſcrupled, but God only? and where doth in appeare, that he fayned ſatisfaction, but its the libellers want of the fear of God, and men, that makes him thus feareles of ſlandering, and contradicting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repentance came not on him, till a long time after, when he ſaw, he could have ſuffred nothing more, though he had denyed the Bill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though the King ſay, <hi>he could have ſuffred nothing more, though he had denyed the Bill,</hi> he never finds, that repentance came not from him till long after, but knew very well, his repentance followed the fact cloſe at the heeles.</p>
               <p>He aſkes a queſtion, <hi>how be could vnderſtandingly repent of letting that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95058:55"/>be Treaſon, which the Parliament, and whole nation ſo judged.</hi> He hath already told vs it was al moſt the whole nation, and the greater part of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but he finds now, that any diminution induces doubt, and it muſt be the Parliament, and whole nation. May not a man vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly repent, becauſe the whole nation was in the ſame fault? how many Acts of Parliament have been made, whereof it had been happy for King, and people, they had repented? there neede not an enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſo Knowne a truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was a worldly repentance, not a conſciencious, or els a ſtrange Tyrany, which his conſcience had got over him to vex him like an evill ſpirit for doing one act of Iuſtice to fortefie his reſolution from ever doing ſo any more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may ſee what account this man makes of ſin, or conſcience, that thus derides the terrours of conſcience.

This libeller cannot perſwade himſelfe, that when he calls murther Juſtice, and Rebellion loyaltie, that he is beleived, though he profeſſe <hi>admiration,</hi> that men <hi>diſreliſh</hi> thoſe his prime qualities, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes the execration of ſuch wickednes to be <hi>ſtrange infatuation,</hi> and <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of heart,</hi> and ſo calls the Kings vnwilling, and forced conſent to an act, he judged evill, <hi>the taſting of a juſt deede,</hi> and his repentance for it, he calls <hi>ſpattring at it.</hi> The Devills are tormented with the repentance of others, and their Agents blaſphemouſly deride it, and its doubtfull, whether the pittie, or deteſtation ought to be greater to wards ſuch deſperate perſons, that call the conſent to an execrable murder, <hi>taſting of one good deede,</hi> and the reſolution againſt the like <hi>ſpattring at it,</hi> no doubt this man ſpatters at conſcience, &amp; direliſhes all repentance, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being ſo naturall to him, as the oppoſition to pietie.</p>

                  <hi>That wo is denounced to the Scribes, and Phariſees for ſtraining at a gnat, and ſwallowing a Cammell.</hi> We ſcarcely finde ſo greate a Cammel ſwallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by the Scribes, and Phariſees, as many, that are greedily devoured by this libeller. His prophane, and malitious ſcornes, and reproaches of repentance in this very ſection, and magnifying an execrable Murther are Cammells in the Jugdment of true Chriſtians, though it ſeeme not ſo to that ſenſe, which is wholy reprobate, the ſtraining at gnats, and ſwallowing Cammels was never more apparent in any ſect of men, then this libeller, and his crew, and if the <hi>ruine of three Kingdomes be ſoe big, &amp; bulky,</hi> as he confeſſes, and would falſely have to be the deedes of his late <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> and that a wo belongs to them, what may this libeller, &amp; his Complices expect, that have ſtrained at formes, and Ceremonies, &amp; ſwallowed downe not only periuries, and Murthers, the defence of odious ſins, and the reproaching of Chriſtian duties, but have vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly brought this ruine vpon his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> three Kingdomes.</p>

               <p>He followes his common place of reproaching his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſayes, <hi>if it were come to that vnnaturall diſcrafie to digest poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it was not for his Parliament, and Kingdomes to feede with him any longer.</hi> This Chapter the libeller hath compoſed for a ſatyre againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to make it more a bhord by his crew of Caniballs, with whome non can feede, but blood thirſtie ſavages. Could he name a greater diſcraſie then what he commends, that confines conſcience to ſhed blood, exludes it from ſparing. Theſe Traytours had made falſhood, and diſobedience unnaturall to them, and thereby they cauſed ſuch, as ſought to preſerve themſelves from that peſtilence, to avoyde them, &amp; thoſe venemous perſons according to their malitious qualitie ſought to infect with their diſpoſition, or deſtroy by their rage all that came neere them, or reſtrained their Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the King would perſwade vs, that the Parliament eſcaped not ſome touches of remorſe for putting Strafford to death in forbidding it to be a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the future;</hi> but he ſayes <hi>in faire conſtruction that act implyed rather a deſire to pacifie the Kings minde, not imagining, that this after Act ſhould be retorted on them, whether it were made a Preſident, or not, no more then the want of a Preſident for this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its ſome what ſtrange, that the Image breaker finding his rigour only to rayle would medle with this Argument, but it ſeemes he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the hope of a fallacie in the word after, &amp; would inſinuate, that this Act was made after the murther, which was made to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe it, and in a <hi>faire conſtruction</hi> it hath not the leaſt ſhadow of a deſire to <hi>pacifie the King,</hi> for it did not diminiſh any of their power, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that contrived that Act, but only to exclude this fact from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Juſtice, which in a <hi>faire conſtruction implyes,</hi> that it was not law, but will, and power, whereby they proceeded. The truth was them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſaw, that by the conſequence of that fact of theirs, all mens lives, and fortunes were expoſed to danger, and ruine, and no Magiſtrate, or officer, but might be drawne within the compaſſe of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> by the Rules they had held with the Earle of Strafford, &amp; all they, that were preſent at the debates of that buſnies know well, that their proper fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res cauſed that proviſion in the Act, and though themſelves were not bound to Preſidents, they were affraid, that others would follow their <hi>Preſidents,</hi> as in truth they ought, if this Preſident had been according to law. He would not have, that this Act argued in the Parliament, <hi>their least repenting, when it argued ſo litle in the King, who accuſed the ſix members for the ſame Crymes, which he would not thinke treaſonable in the Earle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The accuſation of thoſe ſix members was of other, and higher Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, beſides ſome of thoſe objected to the Earle of Strafford, and vpon better grounds, and if it had been only thoſe it ſhewes apparently, that they, that would not proceede vpon that accuſation, repented of what they had done againſt the Earle of Strafford, or had no conſcience at
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95058:56"/>all, but were only guided by corrupt reſpects of perſon, and intereſt, and his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> might try what they would doe againſt perſons evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently guiltie of that, which they had judged ſo high a Cryme in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the diſcovery of their former falſe proceedings; <hi>that the King held nothing Treaſon, but againſt himſelfe.</hi> He hath been already told, was the judgment of the accuſers of the Earle of Strafford, and he might have knowne it to be ſo farr from a <hi>Tyranicall principle,</hi> as he calls it, that it is the rule of law, and Government, for have not his Maſters chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ſtile of proceedings againſt offenders, which the law formerly vſed in regard of their change of Government, and deviſed one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their new modell? Its poſſible they, that deviſed that clauſe in the Act, did not expect, it would be retorted vpon them, they were blinded with their fury, and precipitation. But the Image breaker might have obſerved, that a greater evidence of their injuſtice could not have been provided. He that is ſo ſhameleſſe to inſinuate the <hi>Kings inſtigation</hi> to that clauſe in the Act for the death of the Earle Strafford, which were a madnes in any man to ſuppoſe, may aſwell pretend it for his death. The ſix members muſt ſtand condemned, if he acquit them, for the contrary of what he affirmes is conſtantly true. And it were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aſke him, why he ſhould conclude the ſix members guiltles, that never were tryed, when they were accuſed of ſuch facts, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſayes were Treaſon in others, for he will certainly ſay it, though he thinke it not.</p>
               <p>He concludes againſt the Kings conſcience in ſaying, <hi>that he bare that touch of conſcience with greater regret then any other,</hi> in regard of the <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory aide</hi> (he ſuppoſes) <hi>ſent to Rochell, and Religion abroade, and a Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of ſhedding blood at home</hi> (as he phraſes it.)</p>
               <p>There cannot be a greater evidence of the Kings innocence, and the Rebels lewdenes then their abſurd accuſations of him who after their barbarous reproaches, and crueltie make his greateſt Cryme the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their Rebellion, and the misfortune of an expedition in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Rochell, and Religion. No man is ſo ſenſeles to beleive that Rochell could have defended it ſelfe without other aide, then their owne, &amp; if the King had not intended their releife, he needed not have vndertaken ſuch chrageable, and dangerous expeditions, &amp; whence can any reaſonable man, collect that the Kings aſſiſtance to them could beproditory, when they were not their by hindred to vſe their vtmoſt endeavours, beſides the Engliſh ſuccours, and heereby wee may ſee how miſerably the people of England have been miſled by hipocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Traytours who while they made profeſſion of conſcience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, acted the greateſt villanies againſt Religion and conſcience that the worſt of Atheiſts ever attempted, and ſhame not at ſuch aſſertions of falſhood as common States bluſh to be detected of.</p>
               <p>The reaſon he ſayes is worth the notinge, why the King would have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95058:57"/>notice taken of ſo much tendernes, which is, <hi>he hoped, it trould be ſome evidence before God, and man to all poſteritie, that he was farr from bearing that vaſt loade, and guilt of blood laid vpon him by others, which hath (he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes) the likenes of a ſubtill diſſimulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Prophet David humbled himſelfe, and put on ſackcloth even that was turned to his reproach, and his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> teares, and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſoule are no leſſe reproaches by theis vipers, then the greateſt ſins, that could be repented of. Curſed ſhimi will call David a man of blood, and his repentance for the murther of one man with bitternes of ſoule ſhalbe counted a diſſimulation, rather then the wretch will allow it any evidence, that he was innocent of that blood, he would lay to his charge. This was not the firſt time his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> charged himſelfe with that innocent blood, the Rebells publiſhed his Cabinet, wherein they found it, and he might well hope, that God would cleere his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, as the light, as his righteouſnes, as the noone day. Prayers may be made for mercy to a mans name, and a penitent may piouſly hope God will make his repentance evident to men, and his ſorrowes for one ſin, and evidence he was not guiltie of many of the ſame Kinde. His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> hopes not, that his expreſſions heere wilbe evidence, but that his regretts, which were Knowne not only to God, but men could be evidence, how farr he was from the guilt of what his Enemies char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with, and to declare a hope of the benifit of repentance is no more like a diſſimulation, then repentance is like a juſtification. If his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> 
                  <hi>had ſhed the blood of thouſands, whome he counted Rebells,</hi> as this Author mentions, he could not ſuffer regretts of conſcience, though he had a ſorrow of heart, his vnderſtanding being ſatiſfied of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and neceſſitie of the fact. But thoſe horrid Traytours, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewed themſelves in the blood of that innocent King, were hardned againſt the ſparing of multitudes, and would ſecure their conſciences by reproaching his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> repentance, and transferring the blood of warr vpon him, which their Rebellion, and crueltie had ſpilt. This li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller in this very page within few lines told vs, that ſtrafford was by him put to death <hi>vnwillingly</hi> and preſently concludes, thus by <hi>dipping voluntarily the tipp of his finger in the blood of ſtrafford whereof all men cleere him, he thinkes to eſcape that ſea of blood, wherein his owne guilt hath plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And may not a mans owne conſcience ſtrike him for that, which all men cleere him of? but that himſelfe hath related to be otherwiſe in this caſe, where ſo many concurred in Judgment againſt the death of the Earle of Strafford, and when ſo many have made confeſſion of their owne vnhappines in the conſent to that Action, and ſo few at preſent, that doe not abhorre it, and thinke it a greate cauſe of Gods diſpleaſure againſt the nation, it is farr from truth, that all men cleere him. The Libeller holds a ſingle murther, but dipping the tip of the finger in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95058:57"/>blood, &amp; gives juſt cauſe to conclude, that his conſcience is not toucht with ſhedding a ſea of blood. Al men muſt confeſſe, it a cauſe of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter regret of have his hand in the blood of one man againſt the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his conſcience, then erroneouſly to enter into a warr, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are diſtroyed vpon the opinion of Juſtice, but the knowne Juſtice of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> cauſe, layes the blood of this warr at the Rebells doores, whoſe malice, and Treaſon, not ignorance, or errour drew vpon them the guilt of that blood of Strafford, &amp; thoſe thouſands, which the warr hath devoured. If the King had never publiſhed his repentance for the blood of Strafford, all knowing men would have judged he had cauſe to doe it, and if he had never gone about to purge himſelfe of that blood which the warr had ſhed, all men would have cleered him of it.</p>

               <p>The cryes of his Enemies prove nothing, but their owne paſſion, &amp; partialitie, and the jealoſies of men are oftner reſolved into their owne miſtakes, then the truth of Actions.

                  <hi>That in one of his anſweares to both houſes, he made profeſſion, that he was convinced that it was a plaine breach of the priviledge,</hi> it was greater ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, then ever King gave his houſes of Parliament, and it muſt have been an inexcuſable diſloyaltie in them, to preſſe him after ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and make it matter of complaint.

And as no priviledge of Parliament doth extend to Treaſon, but that a Coneſtable may apprehend any member of that houſe being accuſed of that Cryme, ſo why the King ſhould be forbidden to come to the houſe to cauſe Traytours to be apprehended, none but Traytours, will finde a cauſe, but heere he ſayes he <hi>repreſents it fraudulently.</hi> We have found already it hath been fraudulently expreſſed by the libeller.

There neede not any anſweare to his pretended tendernes of the houſe, that approves ſuch open violence againſt them with Pikes, and Musketts, but reproves ſwords, and Piſtolls. Doth not he thinke, that all men looke vpon him, as a common proſtitute, that vſes ſuch aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of a cauſe, which himſelfe defends, though accompanied with outrage, and violence. <hi>A word of onſet to begin a ſlaughter</hi> could never be expected by ſuch an inconſiderable number, armed only with ſwords, and piſtolls, a ſtrange preparation for a Maſſacre, but there are men apt to be diſordred by any rumours of danger, and ſome are willing to have a pretence for vnwarrantable Actions, &amp; thence proceede theſe onſets in the ayre.

               <p>To imagine a Monarchy, and Commonwealth, or Republique in the ſame ſtate can enter into none, that vnderſtand eyther, nor that a King can commit Treaſon with his ſubjects, or againſt them. Kings have been charged with Tyrany, never with Treaſon, till thoſe brutiſh vndertakers. If there had been any law to make ſuch a Treaſon, this libeller would never have added the word manifeſt, for tis a ſure Rule with him to add moſt vehement aſſeverations, where he knowes there is no colour of truth. He well knowes how carefull the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were, that Treaſon ſhould not be made Arbitrary, and therefore they were confined into one poſitive law, and in that law this Author findes not his fantaſticall Treaſon. Can any, but mad men dreame, that when the priviledge of Parliament extends not to Treaſon, that they cannot committ Treaſon. Its Treaſon by the law to leavy warr againſt the King, and that this libellers Maſters have acknowledged, and can he finde it conſiſtent in the ſame Government, that there can be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the King to leavy warr againſt the Parliament, and becauſe a King may have confederations, and Alliances with Forraigne Princes can ſubjects have ſo too? Theſe are not the opinions, but the Stratagems of Rebels. The people of England are bound to aſſiſt their King againſt any without diſtinction, and the law hath provided for their indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, though the King miſcarry, but lawes are chaffe, when Rebells Raigne. The particulars he mentions, if they had been reall on his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> part, as they are only imaginary, the Actions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells

               <p>

But had he provided any force to ſecure himſelfe againſt inſolence, does that condradict his bearing the repulſe with patience, and heere the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller caſts away his Argument, that he may vſe his ſcurrilitie, <hi>that the Kings heart ſerved him not for ſuch a deſperate Scuffle.</hi> Soe the greate hoſtilitie, and proviſions for a Maſſacre is come to noe more, then to have hazarded a deſperate Scuffle with the vnarmed houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.

               <p>
                  <hi>There were two ſtatutes, that declared he ought firſt to have acquainted the Parliament, who were the accuſers.</hi> Theſe ſtatutes this Author, nor any man els ever read, and if there had been ſuch ſtatutes, that men ought not to be accuſed, before the Parliament be acquainted, who were the Accuſers, they were much to blame that committed ſo many for Treaſon without any Accuſers, and that theſe two ſtatutes ſhould never be practiſed, or knowne before now? How comes it, that the King, nor his Attorney generall can accuſe a man of high Treaſon, when the meaneſt ſubject of the Kingdome may doe it? Its well knowne, that the houſe of Commons vpon the word of MR. Pym, without the leaſt knowledge of the fact, or any accuſer, or witnes, charged the Earle of Strafford of high Treaſon, where were theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes then? <hi>Has Majeſt ſtill profeſſing to governe by law,</hi> as he ſayes, did not way breake it, and he was noe way oblidged to name any accuſers, eſpecially to the Parliament, where a Rebellious, and potent faction vnited themſelves to the Accuſed members, that had contrary to their owne Rules denyed that proceeding, which they declared juſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The faire tryall, which was offred,</hi> was noe other, then to take oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie for juſtifying thoſe members, what ever the proofe were. Had it been thinkes he a prudent Act in the King to have accuſed Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and made a Commiſſion to their fellowes to judge of the fact. He could not doubt of the ſame Juſtice from theſe men, which he found in many other occurrents. Could he ſuppoſe, that they would
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95058:59"/>condemne a Traytour, that had combined to proſecute the Treaſon, and it was not for want of juſt matter, but the forefight of injuſtice, that cauſed his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> 
                  <hi>to lett fall</hi> his proceedings. When Rebells are protected by open force, when the power, and impetuoſitie of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults are boaſted of by this Author, when the inclination of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent faction vnto the members is confeſſed, he would yet have the King chuſe ſuch a Tryall.</p>
               <p>He would have it <hi>a thirst of revenge in the King againſt the members for oppoſition againſt his Tyranous proceedings.</hi> If their innocence of the Treaſon had been as evident, as his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> of Tyranous proceedings, they had never been accuſed, and if they had not been conſcious of their guilt, they would never have ſought Tumultuary protection, and if his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> had thirſted for revenge, he needed not have gone to the houſe of Commons to have ſatisfied it, but Malefactours count legall pcoceedings the malice of Enemies, and effects of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>

               <p>That though the King in his anſweares to the Parliament ſaid, <hi>that as he once concieved he had ground enough to accuſe them, ſo at length, that he found as good cauſe to deſert any proſecution of them, yet heere he ſeemes to reverſe all.</hi>

               <p>It is the Method of the falſe Sectaries to inſinuate an opinion of their vertue by rigid cenſures of others, whereby they draw men from obſervation of their owne lewdenes, &amp; offenſive to ſobrietie, and thence the libeller calls his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> guard <hi>the ſpawne, and ſhipwracke of Tavernes.</hi> Such, as were of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> guard may no thinke to eſcape theſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites thinke to hide their blood guiltines, pride, robbery, perjury, &amp; oppreſſion by reproaching their Enemies with <hi>Stewes, and Tavernes.</hi> The principall zealotts of this Rebellion were the tags, and raggs of the people, who were glad to heare voluptuous living, and riott ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Kings partie, that they might compare their beggery, and baſe condition before other mens vices, whether true, or fayned.

The kings partie are aſſured, that the proceedings againſt him were odious to God, &amp; man, and this Action touching the members was noe other, then neceſſary Juſtice, and there appeares not any purpoſe of violence, or oppreſſion of the innocent, and in vaine doe murderers ſeeke to ſhelter themſelves from the guilt of their impieties by pretending Gods ſecret Counſells, The ſinceritie of his Majeſt; heart is noe leſſe manifeſt, becauſe he ſell into the hands of wicked men, who cannott treade his honour in the

                  <hi>The King being returned from Scotland diſmiſſes that guard, which the Parliament thought neceſſary in the middeſt of ſoe many dangers to have about them.</hi> Its true the conſpiratours in Parliament eyther from the guilt of their conſciences, or advantage to their plots pretended apprehenſion of danger, that they might have a guard, which they might make vſe of to excoute their deſignes and affront the members of the houſe that refuſed to cuncurr to their plotts, and therefore noe guard pleaſed them, but ſuch, as were compoſed cheifely of ſuch perſons, as made vp the Tumults.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King diſmiſſed the guard, which the Parliament thought neceſſary, &amp; put in another contrary to the priviledge of that high Court, and by ſuch a one commaunded as made them noe leſſe doubtfull of the guard it ſelfe.</hi> Its very likely, that they had as litle doubt of danger, from any other, as from the guard, for they ſought to create dangers to others, feared none to themſelves, but from their owne guilt. Its well knowne there was not the leaſt appearance of danger, but from what that faction intended, and ſuch deſire of a guard was noe leſſe vnknowne, then ridiculous to all former Parliaments, and it was ſoe farr from being a priviledge to that high Court, that the leaders of the faction in the lower houſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a vote to deſire it of the king. And how could it be contrary to the priviledge of that high Court for him to change the guards, that had firſt placed them? The guard, which the king appointed was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the cheife officer of that guard, and becauſe he gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund to keepe of the Tumults, therefore the Rebell faction, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their buſnies could not be done by ſuch a guard, nor ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder. <hi>Which</hi> they therefore ſayes he <hi>diſcharge, deeming it more ſafe to fitt free, though without a guard in open danger, then encloſed with a ſuſpected ſafetie.</hi> And in what ſafetie ſate they, that were threatned, and abuſed by thoſe Tumults every day. The viſible cauſe of a guard was the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, but the cauſe, why guards were deſired was to act the ſame for which the Tumults were rayſed, and the danger pretended was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, for they, that deſired a guard would rather be without one, then not have a Commaunder of their owne faction, and the houſes found noe inconvenience in the want of a guard, but in the inſolencie of the Tumults, which the ſeditious faction invited, &amp; would not have them hindred by any guards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The people therefore least their worthyest, and most faithfull Patriotts, who had expoſed themſelves for the publique, and whome they ſaw now left naked,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95058:62"/>ſhould, want aide, or he deſerted in the middest of theſe dangers, came in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, though vnarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d in wittnes their fidelitie, and readines in caſe of any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offred to the Parliament.</hi> It hath been aldeady obſerved, that theſe Tumults preceded the deſire of guards; and they were ſoe farr from being acceptable to the Parliament, that the houſe of Lords deſired their reſtraint, and invited the lower houſe to concurre with them to ſuppreſſe theſe Tumults, and though the factions partie withſtood the motion, yet it was thought neceſſary by a greate part of that houſe to joyne with the Lords in that deſire. And how could they wittnes their fidelitie to the Parliament, when ſoe greate a part thought them a greivance? And why did they menace, and aſſault the members of both houſes? Why did they preſcribe reſolutions to the Parliament, and in caſe their demaunds were not graunted, denounce to rout to the oppoſers? Is this fidelitie to the Parliament? This Author neede not ſeeke ſuch bliede excuſes for Tumults, that juſtifies open Treaſon, noe doubt thoſe his <hi>faithfull Patriots</hi> well-vnderſtood, that their greateſt danger was from the law; which they had violated, and they would be ſecure by ſubverting it, and engaging, multitudes in their owne guilt. The king had reaſon <hi>to ſend into the Citie to for bid ſuch reſorts,</hi> and nothing but ſedition could encourage, or permit them.</p>

               <p>He is now come to tells vs ſome reaſons, why the Parliament peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the king for a guard after they were content to ſit without one, and while be maintanies a power in his imaginary Parliament to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the king, he preſents them petitioning the king for a guard, and their words, which he will not take notice of are worth obſerving. <hi>The Knights Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the houſe of Commons, your faithfull, and loyall ſubjects, who are ready to lay downe their lives, and fortunes, and ſpend the laſt dropp of their blood to maintaine your Crowne; and royall perſon in greatnes; and glory, doe ouſt themſelves downe at your Royall feete,</hi> with ſuch elaborate deceites did they hope to perſwade the king to give them a guard to oppreſſe himſelfe.

A Conſtable of a Pariſh might more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſet a guard about his houſe after the parting of a fray, then the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſeeke for an armed guard vpon ſuch an occaſion. If the tumults were ſoe ſeditious, as to ſhew their inſolencie at the gate of white hall, or Weſtminſter hall, and any of them were wounded in ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly reſorts, it had been juſt, and neceſſary to forbid their comming in ſuch numbers, and provoking ſuch danger, and their continuance is a mainfeſt ſigne, that theſe tumults were not the voluntary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, but the inſtigation of the factious partie in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>That it was <hi>reaſonable, and juſt for the Parliament to make choiſe of their owne guards, and Commaunder</hi> will only appeare to ſuch, as had trayterous plotts againſt the King, and the choice, that they made of the <hi>Earle of Eſſex</hi> ſhewes by their after imployment, and his enſuing Actions, that the King had juſt reaſon for the refuſall, and though this Author thinke, that he hath ſaid ſomewhat by naming him <hi>the Kings owne Chamberlaine,</hi> yet all men ſee, that theſe obligations, which the King had put vpon that Earle, could not with hold him from being a leader to the mad multitude againſt King, and Kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is the right of inferious Courts to make choice of their owne guards,</hi> which is vtterly falſe, but can he tell, that ever an inferiour Court vndertooke to be guarded by a Militia, or that ever they had other guards, then from Conſtables, and inferiour officers, whome they might require to keepe the peace, and doe their dutie, and noe Court could ever make choice of any guard either for number, or Commaunder.</p>
               <p>He ſayes, that why the King refuſed the guard deſired, <hi>the next day made mainfest, for then be came to blocke vp, or aſſault the houſe of Commons.</hi> It ſoone appeared, wherefore they deſired a guard, to protect Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, &amp; deſtroy the King. That the King came to blocke vp, or aſſault, the libelles hath already confeſſed to be falſe, for he did it not, when it was in his power, &amp; if he had refuſed a guard for that reaſon, he would have performed it, &amp; its impertinently alleadged for the cauſe of thoſe tumults, when he hath ſhewed, that thoſe tumults were begun long before, for he lately to vs of the blood drawne at the gate of white hall, and Weſtminſter hall, which himſelfe knowes was in the tumults.</p>
               <p>He proceedes to ſay, <hi>that he had begun to fortifie his Court, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained armed men.</hi> How abſurdly doth he produce any acts of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> which were occaſioned by the tumults to be cauſes of the tumults? fortifying his Court, and entertaining armed men, there was good cauſe for, and what could it ſignifie, that the King fortified his owne houſe? But an apprehenſion of danger. And how could it offend any, vnles ſuch, as were diſaffected to his ſafetie?</p>
               <p>He ſayes theſe men ſoe entertained <hi>ſtanding at his Pallace gate reviled,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95058:63"/>and with drawne ſwords wonnded many of the people, as they paſſed by in a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable manner, whereof ſome died.</hi> His owne relation makes it more then probable, that ſuch, as were wounded gave the occaſion of the hurt they had, for they were not drawne to the Palace gate, and might have quietly paſſed by though any of his Maj: Servants ſtood at the gate, &amp; the truth is they dayly provoked his Maj: with inſolent, &amp; menacinge words, &amp; Actions, &amp; enforced ſuch, as guarded the Court to repel them with force, &amp; if they were reviled, they gave the provocation by their ſeditious carriage, &amp; theſe armed men are now come to drawne ſwords there being no armes found by this Author, but ſwords, wherewith the perſons vſually walked, &amp; which were neceſſarily drawne againſt that rowt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The paſſing by a multitude, though neither to St. Georges feaſt, nor to a til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it ſelfe was no Tumult. The expreſſion of their loyaltie, and ſtedfaſtnes to the Parliament, whoſe lives they doubted to be in danger was noe Tumult.</hi> but wherefore ſhould ſuch a multitude reſort, that had nothing to ſee, vnles they were tumults? If a multitude, of people either at St. Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges feaſt, or a tilting ſhould threaten the King, or with violence preſſe into his Court, and reproach, and aſſualt ſuch, as they found there, this would be a tumult, &amp; ſomewhat more, but this was not al theſe tumults acted, they aſſaulted the members of both houſes neere their doores, they threatned them, that conſented not to what they would have, they preſcribed to the King, and both houſes, what they ſhould doe, &amp; doth this triviall diſcourſer make no difference betweene ſuch Actions, that are the moſt pernitious diſorders in ſtates, &amp; the comming of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to ſee a tilting. If the purpoſe of ſuch multitudes had been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the lives, or ſafeties of any members in Parliament, it was very vnſuteable to their pretence to enquire into the proceedings of the houſes, &amp; aſſualt, &amp; menace the members. The loyaltie, which he ſayes they bare to the Parliament was il expreſt by breaking the priviledges, &amp; wronging the members, their loyaltie was due to their King in the firſt place, &amp; they owed nothing to the Parliament, but as their Kings Court, &amp; Councel, but the Author thinkes fit they ſhould breake their ſworne loyaltie to their King to maintaine a faction agianſt him.</p>

                  <hi>If it grew to be ſo, the cauſe was in the King, &amp; his retinue, who by hoſtile pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, and actuall aſſailing the people gave juſt cauſe to defend themſelves.</hi> can himſelfe believe this dreame of his, when he reades it over, that the kings preparations againſt the tumults after a long continved inſolence againſt him, ſhould more excuſe them for encreaſing their violence, them juſtifie their firſt attempts? Neede they come to white hall, or Weſtminſter to defend themſelves, but their diſorderly, &amp; abſurd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are fit Apologies for a tumultuous rowt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe petitioning people needed not have been ſo formidable to any, but to ſuch, whoſe conſciences miſgave them, how il they had deſerved of the people,</hi> and doe non forbid ſuch petitioning people but thoſe, whoſe conſciences miſgave
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95058:64"/>them, how il they had deſerved of the people? why then were the ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh petitioners, and other ſoe roughly handled comming vnarmed, &amp; more peaceably, then theſe Tumults? And doe the libellers Maſters permitt ſuch petitioning people at preſent, vnles it be ſome of their owne ſuborning? And are the people, which he ſoe lately deſcribed to to be exorbitant, and exceſſive in their motions become ſuch exact jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of al mens meritt, and determine of puniſhment without reſpect to their Rulers. If the libeller would have ſhewen what theſe Tumults wanted to make them Cryminall, and wherefore other Tumults were condemned, he would have found meanes to have come to himſelfe, &amp; have ſayd, that Tumults; were neceſſary. Preparations to Rebellion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the King was ſoe Emphaticall, and elaborate on this Theame will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound leſſe perhapps them he was aware to the commend ation of his Government, for in good Governments they happen ſeldomeſt, and riſe not without couſe.</hi> It is more then perhapps, that this libellers commendation of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults will condemne his defence. If Tumults never happen without cauſe, we muſt accuſe the beſt Governments of giving that cauſe, we are ſure Davids Government wanted them not, but Abſolon, and Sheba ſhall condemne the man after Gods owne heart. Did this libeller thinke any truth in ſcripture, or was he at all acquainted with it, that will have a juſt cauſe for all Tumuls, when we reade ſoe many againſt Moyſes by the children of Iſraell? And it he had pleaſed to have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed the Roman ſtory, he muſt acknowledge many cauſſes Tumults in that ſtate. It like he holds, that Demetrius, and his Craftsmen had a cauſe for their Tumults, and ſurely it was not ſoe violent, as the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult he defends. And if all Tumults, and Rebellions be cauſed by ill Government, we may reaſonably conclude, that the people needed not Governours, that knew ſoe well how to governe themſelves, and did never judge a miſſe of the Actions, or Councells of their Governours. The libeller at firſt ſaid he tooke vp the gantlet for libertie, and the Commonwealth, which he hath now expounded to be for deſtruction of libertie, and Kingdome by Tumults.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If they prove extreame, &amp; pernicious</hi> (that is the Tumults) <hi>the were never counted ſo to Monarchy, but to Monarchical Tyrany.</hi> Who doubts, but Rebels wil pretend Tyrany, &amp; oppreſſion. Did ever reaſonable man before this vnreaſonable creature pretend, that Tumults were not pernicious to all governments, &amp; can any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conceive, that they wil not grow extream, if not prevented, but left to their owne violence? what is become now of his judgment of the peoples exceſſive, and extravagant motions, are theſe none in Tumults? Can any Rebellion want a pretence, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamitie of it be a proofe of Tyrany in the Rulers? There can hardly be ſuppoſed an aſſertion more voyde of truth, &amp; modeſtie. What publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que wickednes was there ever acted to the ſubverſion of Kingdomes, but by Tumults? How many vſurpations, how many murthers of

               <p>
                  <hi>Extreames</hi> he ſayes <hi>are at moſt Antipathy. If then the King ſoe extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flood in feare of Tumults, the inference will endanger him to be the olliert ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame.</hi> Where doth he finde in his learning, that Tumults, and Tyrany are at any Antipathy, which are but one, and ſame thing, for was there ever greater Tyrany exerciſed, then by Tumults? And are not the lawes of all ſtates moſt ſevere againſt Tumults? And can there be any inference from thence, that the Government is Tyrany, are not Government, and Tumults at moſt Antipathy? Its a certen Rule, that all watchfull Governours wil feare Tumults. The King had juſt cauſe to ſeare the Galamities enſuing the violence of Tumults, and this triſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler vainely infers his fancied extreames from a prudent foreſight, and if there were noe other example of cauſeles, and miſcheivous Tumults then thoſe the King complained of, they only were ſufficient to inſtruct the world vpon what miſtaken rumours they are rayſed, and vnto what deſperate impieties they proceede.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He never thought any thing more to preſage the miſcheifes, that enſued, then thoſe Tumults.</hi> To this ſayes the libeller. <hi>Thoſe Tumults were but the milde effects of an evill, and injurious Raigne.</hi> Tumults the prodigious, and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall raignes get vp in a milde, and gracious Government, wherein ſeditious, and trayterous factioniſts take libertie to defuſe their venom among the people, and milde tumults, and loyall Rebellion are phraſes agreable to this mans modeſtie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe ſignes were to be read more apparent in his rage, and purpoſed revenge of thoſe clamours of the people.</hi> That thoſe tumults might overcome the patience of any King, the ſeveritie vſed vpon leſſe provocations by others is a full evidence, but his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> moderation was conſtant, rage, and revenge being only legible in his Enemies. That tumults did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage the miſcheifes enſuinge, al knowing men concurr with his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> and deſcerne the libellers ſervile defence of popular clamours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not any thing portends more Gods diſpleaſure againſt a nation, then when he ſuffers the clamours of the vulgar to paſſe all bounds of law, and reverence to Authoritie,</hi> to this he ſayes, <hi>it portends rather his diſpleaſure againſt a Tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous King.</hi> As God ſometimes gives an evil King to a people, ſoe when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he deſtroyes that King by the <hi>contemptible vulgar,</hi> it is a ſigne of the encreaſe of his diſpleaſure, and ſeldome, or never was any King good, or evill ſoe deſtroyed, but the peoples ſufferings were encreaſed.</p>
               <p>That thoſe, whome he calls <hi>a ſupplicating people, and that did noe hurt to law, or authoritie; but ſtood for it in the Parliament</hi> were a Rebell rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cannot be doubted, ſince the libeller defends them, and he cannot be believed they did noe hurt to law in as much, as he defends the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of law, and the attempts of this <hi>ſupplicating people,</hi> that were in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95058:65"/>order to that end. This ſupplicating is one of his aboliſht Ceremonies, The libeller tells, that they ought to have ſtood for law, the world knownes they did the contrary, and he is wittnes both of their guilt, and his owne falſhood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they invaded the honour, and freedome of the two houſes.</hi> To this he ſayes, <hi>It is his officious accuſation, not ſeconded by the Parliament, who, had they ſeene cauſe, were beſt able to complaine.</hi> And how were they able, when they were threatned, if they did complaine, and becauſe the Parliament is overawed by Tumults, that they cannot complaine, therefore their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not invaded. But how ſhameleſly he charges the King with the officious accuſation, he tells vs in the next words, for he ſayes, <hi>if they ſtrucke, or menaced any,</hi> as the King ſaid, <hi>they were ſuch, as had more relation to the Court, then to the Common wealth, Enemies, not Patrons of the people.</hi> Is not the honour, and freedome of the two houſce invaded, when their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ar ſtrucke, and menaced? And is it an officious accuſation to ſay ſoe? Can this man pretend the name of Parliament, when he will allow the baſe rabble to abuſe them at pleaſure? And could any man but he tell the King, that <hi>perſons elected were not ſent to be Cavelled at by him, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with an vndervalue of their temper, judgment, or affection,</hi> and heere defend the raſcallitie in ſtriking, and menacing the members, and not only vndervaluing their temper, judgment, and affection, but handling them, as cullions. Never was libeller more paſſionately malicious, more blindly abſurd, more wilfully falſe, yet he thinkes he hath a reſerve againſt all oppoſition, for he ſayes, <hi>if their petitioning vnarmed were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of both houſes, what was his beſetting it with armed men.</hi> Is ſtriking, and menacing ſoe quickly returned to petitioning, Is it a way of anſweare not to ſpeake to the queſtion? Did ever Kings of England come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an armed guard to the Parliament, and doe they beſet the houſe, when the guard is at the doore? And can he ſay, that the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with his guard to the houſe is a greater invaſion of the honour, &amp; freedome of the houſes, then the ſtriking, and menacing the members by the Tumults? Doubtles he had conſulted better to his credit to have ſaid nothing, then that, which was ſoe different from the caſe himſelfe had ſtated, and his repetition of petitioning, and ſupplicating people is noe other, then the noyſe of the Epheſian Rabble, that greate is Diana of the Epheſians.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes, <hi>They forbore not rude deportments, contemptuous words, and Actions to himſelfe, and his Court.</hi> And to this the libeller ſayes. <hi>It was not wonder, having heard what treacherous hoſtilitie he had deſigned against the Citie, and his whole Kingdome, that they forbore to handle him, as people in their rage have handled Tyrants heere to fore for leſſe offences.</hi> The ſupplicating, and petitioning people may vſe rude deportments, contemptuous words, and actions. To what purpoſe hath he minced his Tumults into ſupplicating, &amp; petitioning people, when he defends their higheſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence?
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95058:65"/>
                  <hi>The King deſign'd Treacherous hoſtilitie againſt the Cittie, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> The laſt thoughts, that madd men had before their deſtraction run moſt in their fancie in the time of their frenſie, and theſe Traytours having loſt all reaſon inculate ſtill thoſe ridiculous fraudes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with at firſt they ſeduced the people. The deſignes of Treacherous hoſtilitie was one of the Ceremonies, which its now time to give over. Who but an Idiot can beleive, that the King can have Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſignes againſt his Kingdome, whereof ſhal he be King, &amp; whome ſhall he have to execate hoſtilitie againſt his owne Kingdome? but theſe dreames of the blowing vp of Thames, and tales of winde mills, and fiery Dragons are over, and its become the peoples ſorrow, and ſhame to looke backe vpon the cheates, whereby they were deluded. He cannot name any Tyrant ill handled by tumults vpon ſuch preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as he makes, &amp; the moſt wicked Tyrant was not ſoe guiltie, as that people, which exerciſed their rage vpon him, yet the libeller determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that the tumults fury is as juſtifiable, as the Parliaments order, for he aſcribes noe more to the one, then the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They were not a ſhort ague, but a feirce quotidian feaver.</hi> And the libeller ſayes <hi>he may beſt ſay it who moſt felt it.</hi> He will rather boaſt of the greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their villany, then reprove the impietie of it, and therefore he ſports himſelfe with the injuries of it, after his appellations of mildnes, and ſupplicating people, and extolls the higheſt of their violence, as a feirce quotidian feaver, and he is ſoe Lunatique, that out of his malice to the King, he calls them milde, &amp; out of his inſolence confeſſes them violent, and deadly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King would perſwade vs, that men ſcared themſelves, &amp; others without cauſe.</hi> And al men are now ſatisfied of the truth of it, the fraudes being ſoe apparent, and confeſſed by this breaker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wiſe feare, and ſuſpition would finde weapons.</hi> And we have found by experience, that Rebells by ſuggeſting vaine feares, and ſuſpitions have gotten weapons, and armed the people to their owne deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Vpon the Kings repeating the miſcheifes done by the tumults, that <hi>they firſt petitioned, then protected, dictate next, and laſtly overaw the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They removed obſtructions, they purged the houſes, caſt out rotten mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi> He ſayes, <hi>if there were a man of Iron ſuch as Talus by our poet ſpencer, is fain'd to be the Page of Iuſtice, who with his Iron flaile could doe all this, and expedititiouſly without thoſe deceitefull formes, and Circumſtances of law worſe, then Ceremonies in Religion, I ſay God ſend it done, whether by one Talus, or by a thouſand.</hi> Religion, &amp; lawes are leſſe then Ceremonies in this Authors account, and when Pages follow not, nor acknowledge, Maſters Juſtice wilbe ill waited on, ſuch cut-throates are not the Pages of Juſtice, but the furies of hell, and theis this libeller prayes to God for; what will not ſuch call Juſtice to ſatisfie their ambition, and crueltie? Poets are ſhort in their fancies of what the Engliſh Rebells have acted. Their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95058:66"/>Gyants were Pigmyes to theiſe Monſters, and their Hidra too few heads, &amp; too litle venom for the ſervice of theſe Enemies of mankinde. What a ſilly propertie does this libeller make Parliament, and lawes, that ſubjects them to Tumults, and how barbarous are their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that made endeavour to ſubvert fundamentall lawes a Capitall Cryme, and heere he commends the fact, &amp; calls them deceitefull for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and Circumſtances of law. Might he not better have ſaid, they would make good their villanies by the ſword, then prevaricate, and ſay, and vnſay, and pretend Religion, and yet pray God to ſend Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and Confuſions to breake all lawes in order to their deſignes?</p>
               <p>The King ſayes, <hi>they ſubdued the men of conſcience in Parliament, backed, and abetted all ſeditious, &amp; ſchiſmaticall propoſalls againſt Government Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, and Civill.</hi> To this he ſayes. <hi>That it was not the Kings grace, but this Iron flaile, the people, that drove the Biſhopps out of their Baronies, Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dralls, Lords houſe, Coopes, ſurpliſſes, papiſticall innovations, threw downe high Commiſſion, ſtarr chamber, gave vs a trienniall Parliament, and what we moſt deſired.</hi> And is not this brave? Is it a credit to a Church to be thus reformed? Is this the Chriſtian Religion to glory in oppreſſion, robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Rebellion? There is noe doubt, but many things graunted by his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> in the late Parliament, were Acts of grace in reſpect of his compliance with importunitie, in hope thereby to preſerve the people from a Civill warr, not in reſpect of the nature of the things graunted. The libeller might have remembred, that the King never conſented to drive the Biſhopps out of their Baronies, or Cathedralls, and his Trienniall Parliament, which he ſoe much commends is repealed by his new Maſters, for the people muſt not looke for the execution of any ſuch law. And this Iron ſlaile, the raſhnes, and crueltie of a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered multitude hath threſht, and broken the bones, &amp; ſinewes of the people, and made them know the difference betweene a golden Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and an Iron flaile.</p>
               <p>In revenge whereof <hi>he ſayes he now ſoe bitterly inveighs againſt them.</hi> And how can the libeller thinke it bitter, when their Actions, which he confeſſes exceede in impietie the greateſt Crymes, that ever were inveighed againſt? And if we could wonder at any thing, we might wonder at his mention of <hi>Schiſmaticall propoſalls conſented to by the King,</hi> when he wel knowes, noe one thing by him mentioned of Cathedralls, or Ceremonies was conſented to by the King, &amp; noe leſſe ſtrange is it, that the other particulars are by him recited, as intended by the King <hi>to be the Seditious propoſalls,</hi> though all of them are not free from that name, when as there were ſoe many ſeditious, and Trayterous propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls beſides theſe.</p>
               <p>That <hi>theſe Tumults played the haſtie midwives, and would not ſtay the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but went ſtreight to ripping vp, and forcibly cut out abortive votes, to this he</hi> oppoſes, <hi>that the Parliament complained not, and therefore thoſe confluxes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95058:66"/>were not by them thought Tumultous.</hi> And were they not thought Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous by ſuch, as they had expelled, and driven away from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And did he but in his laſt words call them an Iron flaile, and recount the wonders, which they wrought, and now would not allow them to be Tumults? We may beſure the ſeditious faction in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtirred them vp, and ſuch, as differed in judgment, or affection from them, were enforced eyther to be abſent, or ſilent,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what good man had not rather want, any thing the most deſired for the publique good, then attaine it by ſuch vnlawfull, and irreligious meanes,</hi> which is ſayes the libeller <hi>had not rather ſit ſtill, and let his Contrey be Tyranized, then like men demaund their rights, and liberties,</hi> And that is the people ought, when they thinke fit to Rebell againſt their Governours, and ſay their lawes are deceitefull, and their Government Tyranicall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the artificialleſt peice of finenes to perſwade men to be ſlaves, that the Court could have invented.</hi> Is it not Scripture, <hi>that we may not doe evill, that good may come of it,</hi> And what other thing doth the King ſay, or this libeller make the artificialeſt finenes of the Court, Traytours perſwade men, that they demaund their right, while they ſeeke only to oppreſſe the right of all men by a lawles vſurpation, and noe man can doubt, but ſuch, as Rebell will make pretences, and not ſpare the lawes of God by prophane interpretations, nor the Actions of their Rulers by falſe repreſentations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The morall of this leſſon would better ſerve the teacher,</hi> and it is the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſenſe. <hi>What good man had not rather want a boundles, and arbitrary power, and thoſe fine flowers of the Crowne called Prerogatives, then for them to vſe force, and perpetuall vexation to his faithfull ſubjects, nay to wade for them through blood, and Civill warr.</hi> And have not theſe Rebells waded through blood, and Civill warr to place theiſe Prerogatives, &amp; flowers of the Crowne vpon themſelves, and continue force, and perpetuall vexation vpon the people of England to ſet vp a boundles, &amp; arbitrary power. The Kings juſt Prerogatives, and flowers of his Crowne were of abſolute neceſſitie for his peoples ſafetie, &amp; they could be a vexation to noe faithfull ſubjects This libeller hath inherited Cains lurce, a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les motion, and diſcord within himſelfe, that heere talkes of faithfull ſubjects, and by, and by will allow none to be ſubjects, nor faithfull, but the King is their officer, and noe oaths binde them to him.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes, <hi>who were the cheife Demagogues to ſend for thoſe Tumults, ſome alive are not ignorant,</hi> he ſayes <hi>the King cannot coine Engliſh as he could money, &amp; tis beleived this wording was above his knowne ſtile, and ortography, and accuſes the whole compoſure to be conſcious of ſome other author.</hi> And this learned obſervation vpon the word Demagogue deſerves the Laurell. Why is demagogue amore <hi>hob goblin</hi> word, then Pedagogue? And why ſhould the one be above the kings <hi>knowne ſtile, &amp; ortography</hi> more then the other? And why may not the king make an Engliſh word current,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95058:67"/>as well as another, There are very many whoſe knowne ſtile, and orto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy is beneath the Kings, that could have tranſcribed Demagogue out of many Engliſh Authors without offending againſt ortogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If theſe Demagogues were men of reputation</hi> with the rabble, it adds not to their reputation with knowing men, nor leſſens the guilt, nor danger of thoſe tumults, but rather made them more miſcheivous; &amp; the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort of people have ſuch moſt in reputation, as are neereſt to their owne condition being ſtrangers to vertue, and true worth.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>complaints were made, yet noe redreſſe could be obtained.</hi> To this he returnes the Parliaments complaint of danger, and that it <hi>cheered them to ſee ſome ſtore of their friends, and in the Roman, not pettifog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſenſe, their Clients ſoe neere about them.</hi> Though he ſometimes vſe the names of Juſtice, and Patriotts, and love of Countrey, yet he affects nothing more, nor prayſes any thing ſoe much, as ſeditious contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and exploits, and to defend the Tumults, while he would deny there were any, and the ſeditious Gracchy, Catilnie, and other conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours againſt the Roman Senate ſhalbe commended, for what were theſe Clients in the Roman ſenſe, but a powerfull number of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as were readie to fire the ſtate at the commaund of their Patron. The Senate never made vſe of ſuch Clients, but the power of private men by them became the ruine of that ſtare, and he hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a full anſweare, why the Parliament complained not of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, when he boaſts, that they were cheered to ſee them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Parliament, and people demaunded Iuſtice for thoſe aſſaults, if not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> meaning thoſe pretended brawles at the Courtgate. If any had demaunded Juſtice they might have had it, for what ſhould hinder? the procedings of noe Court were ſhutt but by the Rebells.

Their choiſe of the place for that execrable Act before the kings Pallace gate is only an evidence of the pride, and malice of their hearts, and of their ſelfe condemning conſciences, that contrived Circumſtances to diſguiſe their crueltie with a counterfaite of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The king complaines, that <hi>he found noe declarations of the Biſhopps could take place againſt the Tumults.</hi> To this he askes, <hi>was that worth his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that fooliſh, and ſelfe vndoing declaration of twelue Cypher Biſhopps, who were immediately appeacht of Treaſon for that audacious declaring?</hi> Surely it was worth the conſidering in reguard of the Juſtice of the declaration, and the Injuſtice towards thoſe Biſhopps, and there can hardly be produced a more impudent Act by an aſſembly of men, that would allow tumults to offer violence to their members, and charge their members for complaining of the injury with Treaſon.

He would inferr, that the King <hi>had noe cauſe of feare, becauſe he came the next day after his going to the houſe of Commons into the Citie without a guard.</hi> The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived at that time the Citie was not ſoe totally debaucht, but that he might finde ſome, that would guard him againſt the diſloyaltie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and thoſe humble demeanours, which he mentions are well knowne to be moſt inſolent provocations of baſe people, and though at that time the infection was not ſoe venemous, as it grew afterwards, yet the king found diſloyaltie very apparent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though the King might have feared in reguard of his owne guiltines, yet he knew the people ſoe full of awe, and reverence to his perſon, as he dared to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt himſelfe ſingle among them.</hi> If the King had knowne guiltines in himſelfe, he could not have hoped for that awe, and reverence, but his going ſingle at ſuch a time, and after ſoe many affronts ſhewes the audacious ſcurrilitie of this Author, that hath taunted at him ſoe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for ſeares, and terrours, and now ſayes lie dared goe ſingle among ſuch outragious tumults. And if awe, and reverence to his perſon were a commendation to the people, as this libeller would have it, it muſt be the brand of infamy vpon him, and his Rebellious packe, that have troden awe, and reverence vnderfoore, and wickedly deſpiſed, and murthered him.</p>
               <p>He would prove, that the King had no feares after all the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſcoffing at his feares, <hi>becauſe he went into Scotland after the Biſhopps had been worſe handled, then in England, and after two Armies had entred England againſt him, and this he ſayes argues firſt, that he was a ſtranger to England, and full of diffidence. To the Scotts only a native King in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, though not in his dealing,</hi> next he ſayes, <hi>which ſhewes beyound doubting, that all his feare of Tumults was but a pretence.</hi> Wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not boubt, that this Authors braine is a Giddy, as the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, for to prove, that the King had noe feare of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, he affirmes him diffident to the Engliſh confident of the Scotts, and labours much to make periods of non ſenſe, that he may vſe words of Calumnie. Might not the King have cauſe to feare in reguard of their malice, though
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95058:68"/>not his perſonall ſuffering? And doth not his libeller ſhew his vaine falſhood, that heere makes the king feareles, and ſoe lately made mirth of the terrours of the Tumults. he libeller doubted he ſhould not finde credit to his many contradictions touching the tumults, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turnes about to another theame of the Kings relation to the ſcotts, and is ſo voyde of ſenſe, as having affirmed within ten lines before, that the king was confident of the awe, and reverence of the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to his perſon, heere ſayes he was full of diffidence.</p>
               <p>But he ſayes <hi>he tooke occaſion from the Tumults of abſence from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to turne his diſorderly bickerings to an orderly invadinge.</hi> That the King might he abſent without ſhewing a reaſon why, from his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, noe man of knowledge, or common reaſon ever doubted, and he might, as well goe to Yorke, as into Scotland. But he muſt be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by diſorderly Tumults, if he ſtay, and followed with a formed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, if he depart, and they, that ſought Colours, and diſgiuſes for the Tumults grow ſoe impudent to rayſe an Army for the King to fight againſt him.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>he would not have weakened himſelfe by ſoe many former, and after Acts, if he had meditated warr, as ſome ſuſpected, when he left white hall.</hi> The libeller ſayes <hi>his former Acts did not weaken him, &amp; it might come into his minde after paſſing theſe Acts.</hi> That which ſtrengthened the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells muſt weaken him, and was the Act for continuance of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without which they could not have ſate, nor acted, nor deluded the people, nor part of their ſtrength, nor the Kings weakenes? But he that objects cunning fetches, and evill Councellours to the king now allowes him nothing, but improvidence, and feare.</p>
               <p>The King <hi>doubted not, but all had gone well, if the Parliament had ſate ſtill free, as it was in its first election,</hi> and ſayes the libeller, <hi>his not doubting was all good mens greateſt doubt.</hi> And theis are the good men, that could not endure a free Parliament, and the libellers Parliament, that muſt governe is a new modell, not a free Parliament, as it was at firſt elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that ſtood not with their Rebellious diſignes, and his good men doubted, that all would not ſoe well with them, if that ſate ſtill free, &amp; therefore the Iron flaile muſt thruſt the Biſhopps out of the Lords houſe, and purge the lower houſe, and yet it is ſtill Tyrany, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie in the King by this mans judgment not to accept all the Dictates of this ridiculous packe, and he hath a narrow conſcience, and not fitt for the publique, that follows not the cry of this kennell.</p>
               <p>To the Kings reſolution to <hi>heare reaſon, and conſent, as farr, as he could comprehend.</hi> The libeller askes, <hi>what if his reaſon comprehend nothing, but his owne advantages, was this a reaſon to be truſted with the common good of three nations?</hi> Yes truly, and it is noe Paradox, that if the King compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his owne advantages, it is ſufficient for the common good of the three nations, for whatever is their common good is his advantage, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95058:68"/>whatever is his advantage is their Common good, but all his Patriotts for whome the libeller is ſoe Zealous have advantages of their owne, that are oppoſite to the Common good of the three nations.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes, <hi>as ſwine are to gardens, ſoe are Tumults to Parliaments</hi> To this ſayes the libeller. <hi>The Parliament could best have told vs, had they found it ſo.</hi> And doubtles ſuch of the Parliament, as found it not, may be accounted among the number of theſe ſwine, or the herdsme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them.</p>
               <p>But he ſayes <hi>one greate hogge may doe as much miſcheife in a garden, as many litle ſwine.</hi> And it ſeemes, that the like evil ſpirit, as entred into the heard of ſwine hath poſſeſt this libeller, and driven him on head long in his Rebellious impudence.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes, <hi>he was ſome times prone to thinke, that had be called this laſt Parliament to any other place in England, the ſad conſequences might have been prevented.</hi> To ſhew, that the place could have made noe change, the libeller inſtances in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> firſt Parliament at oxford, which was diſſolved. What doth that prove to contradict what his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, that if he had called the Parliament at another place, theſe fad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences might have been prevented? Does the libeller thinke, that becauſe there was miſvnderſtanding betweene the King, and ſome of his Parliaments, that they would therefore have run to the ſame extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, that he faction in this laſt did, or that theſe factioniſts could have brought this miſcheife vpon the kingdome, by like Tumults in another place.</p>
               <p>He goes on to ſay, <hi>that the King called his last Parliament at Oxford a Mungrell Parliament conſisting all of his friends.</hi> Noe doubt there were in that Parliament many loyally affected to his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> but it cannot be denyed, for time hath tryed it, that there were many among them, that were ſpyes, and diſturbers corrupted by the Rebell faction at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, and their owne baſe inclinations, who ſought to diſorder all Councells, and conſultations.</p>
               <p>The libeller would comprehend the whole people of England within the Tumults, &amp; interprett the Kings prayer againſt the tumults to be a prayer againſt his people. Is it not God, that ſtilleth the raging of the ſea, &amp; madnes of the people? And is not a prayer for the people to pray they may be delivered from ſuch madnes, and yet this libeller ſayes, that the king praying to be delivered from the Tumults prayeth to be delivered from the people, and blaſphemouſly concludes, God ſave the people from ſuch interceſſours. And we cannot beleive, that God is in his thoughts, whoſe mouth ſoe often abuſeth his name.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95058:69"/>Parliament very inconſiderate, that would ſoe much Importune a law ſoe farr ſhort, of what former lawes had enacted.

And its contrary vnto the writt, whereby Parliaments are called, that the time of Parliaments ſhould be defined, for it is recited to be an Act of Councell to call a Parliament, which needed not, if it were neceſſary at a prefixed time.</p>

                  <hi>The ſecond Bill</hi> he ſayes <hi>was ſoe neceſſary, that nothing in the power of man more ſeemed to be the ſtay of all things from ruine, then that Act.</hi> We are ſure, that nothing did more confirme the deſignes of the Traytours nor haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that ruine of the Kingdome they have wrought, then that Act.

               <p>
                  <hi>The King paſt theſe Acts vnwillingly.</hi> It cannot be doubted, but the King foreſaw the danger of both, and the libeller might have ſeene in the firſt ſection of this Chapter, that his Maj: was not without doubt, <hi>that what he intended for a remedy might prove a diſeaſe beyound all remedy,</hi> and though to avoyde a Civill warr he made ſome conceſſions in hope to bring the people to ſee their owne good, which might turne to his, and their greater miſcheife, if by them ill applyed, yet his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves prayſe, and thankes for ſuch Acts of grace, and the neceſſitie, which this libeller ſoe impudently vrges to take of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> juſt thankes. was the danger of a Civill warr, which his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ſought by theſe Act to prevent, and might have entred into with leſſe hazard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the paſſing of theſe Bills, then after. The libeller only encreaſes the infamy of the Rebells ingratitude, and his owne impudence by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding neceſſities to take of the Kings grace in paſſing thoſe Bills, and it had not the ſhape of <hi>a Maſterly brow,</hi> but gracious aſpect in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſt: ſaying the greatnes of the obligation above their deſerts, that he had put vpon them by paſſing the firſt Bill, and the Maſterly brow ſuites not with the following ſcurrilous conceite, that the kings recital of the obligation he had putt vpon them by that Act was, <hi>as if he had beggd an office to a ſort of his deſertles groomes,</hi> and theſe deſertles groomes now Rule the new Republique, there being none, that had the leaſt deſert that would accept ſuch a Trayterous office.</p>
               <p>That the King paſſed the latter Bill to prevent the encreaſe of the preſent diſorders, not out of conſideration of the fittnes of that Bill, he neede not ſpend time to prove, and his conſent was moved from the reaſon of the time, not the matter, and the libeller hath well obſerved, <hi>that they had offended him much more after the paſſing of the former Bill,</hi> which is not to their creditt, but ſhame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was feare made him paſſe the Bill, leaſt the Parliament, and people incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his conſpiracies ſhould reſent his doings, if he had added the denyall of this only meanes to ſecure themſelves.</hi> Either his memory is ſhort, or his abſurditie vnnaturall that ſoe lately ſaid the kings feares were preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and does he thinke, that his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> could feare their reſenting more at that time, then afterward, beſides his ſuppoſed fantaſticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies were not as much, as named, or ſpoken of to Parliament, or people at the time of paſſing that Bill, and there cannot be imagined

The libeller cannot excuſe neither the ingratitude, nor diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie of the Rebel partie in Parliament, from the Kings conſent to theſe lawes to preſent diſorders, and miſcheifes, which in themſelves had not been fitt, for his conſent at another time, and their inſolence <hi>in binding him firſt of all his Predeceſſours,</hi> ſhewes their corruption, and guilt, that would vſe ſoe much violence, &amp; diſloyaltie to a Prince whoſe, gratious Government had leaſt of all his Predeceſſours provoked it.</p>
               <p>The King taxes them <hi>with vndoing what they found well done.</hi> The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller ſayes. <hi>They vndid nothing in the Church, but Lord Biſhopps, Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies Ceremonies, high Commiſſion judged worthy by all true Proteſtants to be throwne out of the Church.</hi> Theſe Proteſtants, which are true only to him will judge the like of all Kings, and Rulers of State, and all orders of the Church, that are not of their Bedlem patterne. Theſe falſe Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries talke of Church, &amp; true Proteſtants juſt as they doe of Parliament, as long, as it conſiſts of their owne limbs, it muſt be obeyed, but if it diſſent from their Commaunds, then they are worſe, then Ceremonies in Religion. Doubtles al true Proteſtants abhorre this den of Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, that boaſt of their Rebellious defacing of the Church, and hate their ſocietie, there having not been yet any true Proteſtant, Church, that ever pretended, that Lord Biſhopps, Leiturgies, Ceremonies, or high Commiſſion were worthy to be throwne out of the Church the greateſt part of Proteſtants retaining the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The vndid nothing in the ſtate, but irregular, and grinding Courts.</hi> The Courts they tooke away were judged by al wiſemen to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Kingdome, and fitt to be continved, and the beſt Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſometimes graunt that to the peoples irregularities thereby to preſerve them from proceeding to their owne ruine, which were fitt to deny at another time, &amp; its their Zeale to publique ſafetie, not feare, and diſſimulation, as the libeller calls it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was a greater confidence of the people to put into one mans hand a power to Summon, and diſſolve Parliaments, then the King put in the people by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

But how had they put it into his hands, or what confidence was it, if they might take it away, when they liſt? This man cannot ſee truth through his owne contradictions, &amp; while he acknowledges the Kingly power to Summon, and diſſolve Parliaments forthwith adds, that <hi>Kings could not diſſolve Parliaments till all greivances were redreſſed,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:95058:71"/>and then where was the kings power to diſſolve, or the peoples confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</p>
               <p>This is he ſayes <hi>not only the aſſertion of this Parliament,</hi> a ſtrong proofe, but <hi>of our ancient lawe bookes,</hi> that noe man ever read, <hi>which averr it to be an vnwritten law of Common right ſoe engraven in the hearts of our Anceſtours, and by them ſoe conſtantly enjoyed, and claimed, as that it needed not enrolling.</hi> this is pretty poetry, that becauſe a law is no where to be found, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was engraven in the hearts of our Auceſtours, where are thoſe law bookes? But how many hundred yeares ſince was this engraving worne out, ſurely if there had been either ſuch an vnwritten law, and ſoe conſtantly enjoyed, and claimed, it would have been often enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ere now, but the libeller expected applauſe for his conceite, not creditt to his aſſertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Scotts could charge the King with breach of their lawes for breaking vp that Parliament without their conſent, it were vnreaſonable, that the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of England ſhould be ſoe wanting to it ſelfe, as not to provide againſt the not calling, or arbitrary diſſolving of Parliaments.</hi> If they had provided againſt it, where was the confidence he talked of? It followes not, that becauſe the Scotts charged the King with breaking of the Parliament without their conſent, that therefore the King offended in it, neither was the wiſedome of the Engliſh nation wanting to it ſelfe in leaving the calling, and diſſolving of Parliaments Arbitrary to the King, it being a power eſſentiall to Monarchy, and we have ſeene, that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of that power diſſolves the Government, and drawes confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and miſerie vpon the ſtate, and it cannot be avoyded, but that from a power erected to affront the ſoveraigntie, there muſt follow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and Civill diſcord. People muſt depend vpon their Kings grace, and goodnes for redreſſe of their greivances, whoſe power, and ſafetie conſiſts in their welfare, not ſeeke by violence to be their owne Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and the people never found ſoe greate ſuffering by ſubmiſſion to their, Kings, as by ſeeking wayes to oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It appeares, that if this Bill of not diſſolving were an vnparalleld act, it was a knowne, and Common right.</hi> That it was an vnparalleld Act he doth not deny, that it was a Common right noe where appeares, and how can that be an vnparalleld Act, that is a Common right?

                  <hi>That the Tumults threatned to abuſe all acts of grace, and turne them into wantoneſſe.</hi> This ſayes the libeller <hi>is abuſing of Scripture not becomming ſuch a ſaint to adulterate ſacred words from the grace of God to the acts of his owne grace.</hi> And is it an abuſe of Scripture to ſay the King did Acts of grace? and whence then comes it to be an abuſe of Scripture to ſay the people abuſed the Kings grace, or turned it into wantoneſſe? was it not a ſin of wantoneſſe in the people and may it not be ſoe expreſt without any abuſe of Scripture. Scripture is abuſed, when it is applyed to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95058:72"/>&amp; ludicrous ſenſe, but the words heere are not transferred from a right ſignification. There are diverſe words, that ſignifie both divine, and humane Actions, &amp; there is noe abuſe of them in either ſenſe And the libeller having excepted to the vſe of an expreſſion of Scripture, preſently makes bold with Scripture ſaying, that <hi>Herod was eaten vp with wormes for ſuffering others to compare his voyce to the voyce of God.</hi> when as the Scripture ſayes, he was eaten vp of wormes, becauſe he gave not God the glory.

               <p>That <hi>the King by this Phraſe gives jealoſie, that he likens his owne Acts of grace to the Acts of Gods grace cannot be</hi> vnderſtood, noe more then the vſe of the name of mercy, or juſtice ſhould give jealoſie of likening humane vertues to divine Attributes, though there be a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene reſembling, and comparing,</p>
               <p>The libeller ſayes <hi>from prophanes he ſcarce comes of with perfect ſenſe,</hi> To prove, that he ſhewes himſelfe ſenſeles. The Kings words are, that <hi>being not in a Capacitie to have taken revenge in a hoſtile way, he could not have given his Enemies a more deſired advantage, then by ſoe vnprincely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, to have aſſaulted them with Armes, thereby to ſcatter them, whome but lately he had ſolemnely ſetled.</hi> And where is the libellers exception? he ſayes <hi>what place could there be for his inconſtancie to doe a thing, wherein he was in noe capacitie?</hi> There was place for inconſtancie, if he had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to vndoe that, which he had done, though he were not in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie to have effected it, and if the libeller had ſenſe he would not have miſſed it &amp; come of without it.</p>

               <p>The king ſayes <hi>his letting ſomemen goe vp to the Pinnacle of the Temple was a temptation to them to caſt him downe headlong.</hi> By this ſayes the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller, he compares himſelfe to Chriſt who is not at al named. <hi>The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to the Devill,</hi> which is not neither, and <hi>that ſetling Act his letting them goe vp to the Pinnacle of the Temple.</hi> The libeller ſayes <hi>its a goodly vſe of Scripture.</hi> Similitudes of Actions imply noe Compariſons of perſons, but the congruitie of the alluſion made the libeller angry, and yet he may not be beleived, that the Actions of ſome Traytours, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly his Maſters may not be reſembled to that of Judas without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the perſon betrayed to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He ſayes, <hi>it was noe Pinnacle of the Temple, but a Nabucadnezars Pallace, from whence he, and Monarchy fell headlong togeather.</hi> Thoſe Rebells have tobbed, and ruined the Temple, as Nebucadnezar did, and they, that glory in caſting king, and Monarchy headlong have the ſpiritt of that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95058:73"/>tempter, which perſwaded our ſaviour to caſt himſelfe downe. The people now, as theis of old finde it the extreamitie of deſolation to be without King, and Church, and it is an horrour to them, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpiritts of Rebellion inhabite the Kings Pallaces.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>All the Kingdomes of the world are not worth gaining by wayes of ſin, which hazard the ſoule.</hi> And ſayes the Libeller, <hi>he left nothing vnhazarded to keepe three.</hi> He hazarded nothing, but what he was bound to God, and his people for the preſervation of his Kingdomes, and theſe Rebells left noe wickednes vnattempted to gett them.</p>

                  <hi>The Act of ſetling was noe ſin of his will,</hi> and the Libeller ſayes, <hi>It was a ſin of his vnwillingnes.</hi> But his falſ hood is proved willfull in this, as in moſt of his aſſertions. The King confeſſes the ill conſequence of that Act, but he ſayes it was not a ſin of his will, becauſe it proceeded from other mens malice, and though he willingly paſt the Act, yet he judged the Evill enſuing, not the Act of his will, and it was a ſin of the Libellers will, that ſoe knowingly perverted his meaninge.</p>
               <p>The Libeller ſayes, that <hi>at his prayers, he had before him the ſad preſage of his ill ſucces.</hi> And is it his fault to deſcerne his Enemies crueltie, and his owne afflicted condition?</p>

               <p>The King formerly expreſt, <hi>that valour is not to be queſtioned, for not ſcufling with the ſea, or an vndiſciplined rabble.</hi> And though he had not a baſe feare he could not be vnapprehenſive of violence intended by that rabble, and it cannot be doubted, but that a King muſt have a greater meaſure of ſhame then feare to ſee ſuch inſolencies, and if this libeller had any ſhame, he would not have argued from that expreſſion of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> a contradiction of what he ſaid of danger from theſe Tumults. But he thinkes his readers have a ſhort memory, as well as ſenſe, and therefore he reguards not the repugnancie of his owne Periods.</p>
               <p>He magnifies <hi>the courage, and ſeveritie of Zeale to Iuſtice in Rebells of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times,</hi> and calls them <hi>our fore Fathers,</hi> and that their folly, &amp; wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes may have ſome excuſe in following ſubtile conſpiratours againſt their King, he calls it <hi>courage, and ſeveritie of Zeale,</hi> and that he may au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize their lewdnes, he ſayes their courage was againſt <hi>the proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and miſrule of their Kings.</hi>

               <p>He ſayes, <hi>that when Rich. the</hi> 2. <hi>departed, but from a Committee of Lords, who ſate preparing matter for the Parliament, not yet aſſembled to the removal of his evill Councellours, they firſt vanquiſhed, and put to flight Robert de Vere, his cheife favorite, and then comming vp to London with a huge Army requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King, then withdrawne for feare, but noe further of then the Tower to come to Weſtminſter, which he refuſing they told him flatly, that vnles he came they would chuſe another.</hi> And who can reade this relation, but muſt judge, that it was a Trayterous conſpiracie of theſe Lords, and a giddy, wicked Rebellion in the people? By what law was the king bound to attend theſe Lords, or what authoritie had they to prepare matter for the Parliament, more then any others of the Kingdome? Is it not a knowne Treaſon to endeavour to depoſe the King, and did not the late Parliament profeſſe to abhorre the thought of it? And how comes it to paſſe, that theſe Lords have a power to threaten the King with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him? What Rebells can be convicted by any law, if this Action be not Treaſon? The libeller getts nothing by this example, but an evidence againſt his Maſters, for theſe Lords, and their aſſiſtants had their pardon for that Rebellion. And wherein did this Rebellion of theſe Lords differ from that of Jach ſtraw, and other Traytours men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Mr. Sollicitour againſt the Earle of Strafford. His folly in ſeeking to draw an Argument from the Actions of Rebells, to prove a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95058:74"/>Cryme in the King is ridiculous to any reaſonable man, and its not imaginable, that the king ſhould be bound to attend any meeting of his Peeres, and Councellours, which did tend towards a Parliament, for by that Rule he muſt attend in as many places, as there are factions noe ſober time ever pretended, that the king was bound to attend the Parliament, which was to be called, and diſſolved by him, and our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours would be eſteemed as voyde of reaſon, as loyaltie, if their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments were governed by a Tumultuous rabble, and the king were oblidged to doe what they would have, though the whole kingdome were bleeding to death of thoſe wounds, which their impious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate violence, and fury had inflicted.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes <hi>the ſhame was to ſee the barbarous Rudenes of thoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multe to demaund any thing.</hi> And this the libeller beleives was <hi>the trueſt cauſe of his deſerting the Parliament.</hi> And was it not a juſt cauſe for him to deſert the Parliament, or faction in it, when either they could not, or would not reſtrayne that barbarous rudenes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The worſt, and ſtrangeſt of that any thing they demaunded was but the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lording of Biſhopps, and expelling them the houſe, and the reducing of Church diſcipline to a conformitie with other Proteſtant. Churches.</hi> And this the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller would have noe Barbariſme. What did the Parliament there, if the Tumults may demaund the alteration of the Government of Church, or ſtate? Can it be preſumed, that a rowte of Mechannicks could determine what, was conformitie to other Proteſtant Churches. The libeller at firſt remembred Mr. Solicitours diſcourſe againſt the Earle of Strafford, there he might have found, that it was Treaſon to goe about, &amp; aſſemble a multitude to alter the Government of Church, or ſtate; And to ſeeke the vnlording of Biſhopps by force, in that manner they did was Treaſon by the law, and we have ſeene, that this deſperate rabble, whoſe demaunds the libeller ſayes were but the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lording of Biſhopps, and the like thinke the murther of the king, and deſtruction of his family noe other then a but.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They were demaunded by the Parliament,</hi> which is vntrue, but they were demaunded by a factton, who ſuborned theſe Tumults to overaw, and drive away the greateſt part of the members of both houſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King in a moſt tempeſtuous ſeaſon forſooke the helme, and ſteerage of the Common wealth.</hi> He withdrew himſelfe from that ſtorme, which the Traytours had rayſed againſt him, and admitted not any ſteerage, when all was whirled by tempeſtuous Tumults. The libeller would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mince the cauſes of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> departure, and therefore he catches hold of the mention of ſhame to exclude feare, &amp; from the barbarous rudenes of the Tumults to demaund any thing, he would conclude; there were only demaunds, &amp; noe barbarous rudenes, and would make the laſt word to exclude all, that went before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To be importuned the removing of evill Councellours, and other greivances was
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95058:74"/>to him an intollerable oppreſſion.</hi> To offer violence to him for his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faithful Councellours, &amp; the ſupport of Government in Church, and ſtate was intollerable, and though the libeller doe commend the violence of the Tumults, yet heere he calls it only importunitie, and the Kings denyall of the impetuous demaunds of a rabble to change the Government in Church, and ſtate denyall, and delay of Juſtice. If violence be lawful, as he ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirmes, why doth he mince his defence, and ſoe often fly to theſe termes of importunitie, and petitioning?</p>
               <p>The advice of his Parliament was eſteemed a bondage, becauſe the the King ſayes of them, <hi>whoſe agreeing votes were not by any law concluſive to his judgment,</hi> for ſayes the libeller, <hi>the law ordaines a Parliament to adviſe him in his greate affaires, but if it ordaine alſo, that the ſingle judgment of a King ſhall outballance all the wiſedome of his Parliament, it ordaines that, which fruſtrates the end of its owne ordaining.</hi> There is no doubt, but in a Monarchy the dependence of the people is vpon the King the greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of whoſe intereſt in the proſperitie of the Kingdome is more likely to oblidge him to their preſervation, then any number of private men can be encleined to, and as the law ordained a Parliament to adviſe him, ſoe it forbidds them to commaund, or preſcribe him, though the Major part of Parliament involve the whole, Its againſt all reaſon to include the King, who is allwayes furniſht by law with his other Councells, &amp; may ſee good reaſon to preferr the Counſell of the ſmaller number, and that law, which ordained the Parliament to be called, and diſſolved by the King had deſtroyed what it ordained, if the King had been bound to conſent to all advices given him by the Parliament. Such a reſtraint vpon the King not only makes voyde, and vſeles thoſe ſelect Councells, which by law are continually to adviſe him, but deſtroyes the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Monarchy, which the law cannot intend, and gives the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the abſolute ſoveraigntie, which the people would not live vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being contrary to their deſires, and diſpoſitions, &amp; the truſt repoſed in ſuch, as they elected.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Kings judgment may diſſent,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>to the deſtruction of himſelfe, and Kingdome,</hi> And ſoe doubtles may the judgment of a major part in Parliament, and we have found by long experience, that Parliaments have produced Acts to the preiudice of the ſtate, and corruption of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but this libeller holds all meanes fruſtraneous, that beget not Rebellion, and as in his affection he preferrs the judgment of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, before the Kings; ſoe any Company, or committee of Lords, that conſpire againſt him, as appeares by his late remembred inſtance againſt Rich: the 2: And what power he would have in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over the King, he would place in the Tumults, his admired Iron flaile over the Parliament, and prayes vnto God to ſend them, that they may purge the Parliament, and preſcribe lawes both to the King, and them, and therefore he judges, that it is vnlawlike, that <hi>a remedy ſoe ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95058:75"/>ſhould be the vtmoſt meanes of publique ſafetie.</hi> And we are ſure, that Rebellion, the only remedy, which he approves, is the deſtruction of al publique ſafetie, and ſhewes the Libeller as vnable to judge of law, as vnwilling to obey any.</p>
               <p>He concludes, that <hi>the Kings negative voyce was never a law, but a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonles Cuſtome growne vp from flattery, or vſurpation.</hi> And how ſhall wee judge, that ſoe long a Cuſtome without contradiction was noe law? &amp; that the contrary was an vnwritten law, and conſtantly enjoyed, &amp; clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Can he thinke, that becauſe the ſupport of Rebellion is a ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of law, that therefore Rebells reaſons are the rule of law? And yet he is confident, it is <hi>better evidence, then Rolls, and records,</hi> &amp; as they deale with law, ſoe with Scripture making their fantaſticke dreames, &amp; Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall infuſions the Canon of their Religion. And the Monarchy of David, and his ſucceſſours ordeined by God, and that had both a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and affirmative voyce, was a reaſonleſſe Cuſtome from flattery, or vſurpation.</p>
               <p>He proceedes to ſhew the ſtrength of his Argument. <hi>Becauſe the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative voyce is claimed to one man, not as a wiſe, or good man, but as a King.</hi> And how doth he claime the power of the Parliament as to wiſe, or good men, or as to elected men? And it may be eaſily ſuppoſed, that the Major part of the Parliament may not be ſoe wiſe, and good, as their King, eſpecially ſoe aſſiſted by other Councells, as kings are, and it were noe <hi>abuſive thing to Summon Parliaments,</hi> though the King doe take their advices by weight, &amp; not by number, but it were an abuſive thing, that ſuch, as were called to adviſe, ſhould take vpon them to determine.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes. <hi>The whole Parliament repreſents not him in any kinde.</hi> To this ſayes the Libeller. <hi>If the Parliament repreſent the whole kingdome, the king repreſents only himſelfe, and a king without his kingdome in a Civill ſenſe is nothing, nor without, nor against the repreſentative, and ſoe his negative as good, as nothing, and though we ſhould allow him ſomething, yet not equall to the whole kingdome, nor them, that repreſent it.</hi> But what anſweare is this to the King, that being not repreſented, cannot be bound by the votes of them, that repreſent him not? Is the Libellers making him nothing, or not equall to the repreſentative any reaſon why he ſhould be bound by their votes? The King is by law, &amp; reaſon the repreſentative of the Kingdome, &amp; as this ſottiſh libeller cannot deny it out of Parliament, ſo he might well ſee, that the election of perſons to adviſe him, doth not take away that ſupream repreſentation, which the law hath given him. there can be nothing more abſurd, then that an elected company repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting ſubjects to their King, ſhould take away the Kingly repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; it is a ridiculous ſophiſtrie, that becauſe the king is not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, therefore he is without his kingdome. The people in Parliament are repreſented petitioning, and conſenting, not commaunding, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting, &amp; it is repugnant to their condition to be equall, or not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

               <p>The king maintaines <hi>to be no further bound to agree with the votes of both houſes, then he ſees them to agree with the will of God, with his juſt rights, as a King, and the generall good of the people.</hi> The Libeller would allow him freedome <hi>with due bounds, but not, that he ſhould have a negative, vpon that, which is agreed by the whole Parliament.</hi> Where are his bounds now? for if he have noe freedome, where they agree he hath none at al, for if they doe not agree, he can neither conſent, nor diſſent, but ſuch poore ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſmes are the reaſon of theſe popular Tribuns, and they will have both affirmative, and negative in the Tumults, but not in the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To know the will of God better then his whole Kingdome, whence ſhould he have</hi> it? The Libeller doubtles will, affirme, that himſelfe knows the will of God better, then many whole Kingdomes, and why will he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that poſſible to a King? I may aske him, why he ſhould call the judgment of the Parliament, or a Major part of it, the judgment of the whole Kingdome, when the Major part of the Kingdome be of another minde, if becauſe they repreſent it, then why may not the Kings judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the higheſt repreſentation be preferred before theirs? If the Libeller were put to tell whenever ſuch an Action had happened, that the king diſſented from his whole kingdome, he would hardly finde it, when people have in greateſt multitudes oppoſed their king, they were rarely, or never in the right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To know the will of God better, then his whole kingdome, he askes, whence ſhould he have it? Court breeding,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>and converſation of flatterers was a bad ſchole.</hi> But converſation with Sectaries, &amp; Rebels was worſt of al, kings may be preſumed to have better breeding, then any others, and the Libeller in another place argues from the kings breeding a greater expectation of abilitie. Flatterers are moſt hatefull to kings, and their principall breeding is to avoyde the inſinuations of ſuch deceivers, but the preſent faction have outdone all Court flatterers in falſhood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The king could not judge of his owne rights,</hi> but he had a right to keepe them, when they were judged. He ſayes <hi>the king had noe right by law to judge in any Court.</hi> And yet he judged in all Courts, all judgments being in his name, and we are ſure, that the lower houſe could never judge of the ſmalleſt caſes, nor the higher, but in reſpect of the kings preſence among them, becauſe the king judges by his delegates doth he not judge, or can they judge his Crowne to themſelves.</p>
               <p>That <hi>the king cannot judge of Treaſon, &amp; fellony becauſe he is held a partie.</hi> And why did he then exclaime, that the king ſhould hold noe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but againſt himſelfe, but if that were the reaſon his Judges were incompetent, aſwell as he, but it is neceſſary that in a learned profeſſion, as the law, the king ſhould judge by others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The kings rights,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>muſt give place to generall good.</hi> But it is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95058:76"/>generall evill to take away his rights. He may not yeilde to Traytours, that deſire him to part with them for their owne advantages. It is noe arrogance in a king to ſuppoſe a cleerer inſight of the generall good, then others, though choſen for the Parliament, whoſe breeding, and condition could not quallifie them for ſuch a deſcerninge, and it is a fond imagination in the Libeller to ſuppoſe the Parliament the kings Councell, and ſuppoſe the king voyde of Judgment to deſcerne the foundnes of their advice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They have moſt authoritie to judge of the publique good, who for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are choſen out, and ſent by the people to adviſe him.</hi> But it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that he hath moſt authoritie, whome they are ſent to adviſe, their authoritie being to adviſe, his to determine, and being ſent to adviſe they deſtroy their owne authoritie, and office, when they Commaund.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the King ſee oft the major part of them not in the right, it had been more his modestie to have doubted their ſeeing him more oft in the wrong.</hi> The libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler preſcribes modeſtie to the king, inſolence, &amp; impudence to ſubjects, that the Rule of their Rebellion. If the king had not governed his Actions by good advice, nor ſeene the often Levitie, and precipitation of a Major part, he ſhould have doubted of their ſeeing him in the wrong, however they owne him dutie, as their king, he no ſubmiſſion to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the King ought to graunt the peoples rights, and liberties, becauſe of right demaunded, it being his dutie, not his bountie to graunt theſe things.</hi> But it is the ſubjects miſerie, aſwell as their madnes to demaund the kings rights, as their owne, and we know, that the demaunds of Rebells are for themſelves, and to take away the peoples rights, aſwell as loyaltie, and wee finde, that there were ſuch, as the king mentions, whome noe fountaine of Royall bountie was able to overcome, and for whome the compariſion of hidropike thirſt was very favourable being more inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate then <hi>guſlers</hi> in a <hi>wine</hi> ſellar, and neerer the nature of horſe leaches, and ſwine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King confeſſes a rationall ſoveraigntie of ſoule, and freedome of within every man, and yet with an implicite repugnancie would make vſeles that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of will in all other men but himſelfe.</hi> That cannot be by vſing the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of his negative voyce, for are the wills of other men captivated becauſe they cannot doe as they will, &amp; becauſe the king will not doe what they will have him, and becauſe men are ſubject to Government is freedome of will denyed them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Them, that yeilde him the obedience</hi> meaning the king, <hi>he pronounces wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be ſlaves,</hi> which he inferrs from theſe words of the King, the <hi>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be a ſlave, who captivates the rationall ſoveraignetie of ſoule, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his will to compulſion.</hi> And how can the libeller draw any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from theſe words? Lawes, that reſtraine Actions doe not cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the will, nor doth he conſent to have his will captivated, that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95058:76"/>ſubmitts to Government. But he captivates his will, that Acts what another directs him, though he judge it evill, and in ſuch caſe a law may not be obeyed, though violence may not be vſed againſt the law-maker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What that Freedome is which cannot be denyed him as a King, becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him as a man, &amp; a Chriſtian</hi> the Libeller ſayes, <hi>he vnderſtands not, if it be his negative voyce, it concludes all men, who have not ſuch a negative, as his againſt the whole Parliament, to be neither men, nor Chriſtians.</hi> And as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well he might have ſaid, that becauſe every man ought to have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in giving his vote in Parliament, therefore every man ought to be there. The Libeller neede not be aſhamed to confeſſe ignorance, that bluſhes not at ſuch fooleries. The king argues, that he could not be debarred of that, as a king, which belonged to him as a man, and a Chriſtian, which was libertie of will in giving his vote, and by what Logicque could the Libeller thence conclude, that all, that have not a negative voyce to what the Parliament propounds are noe men, nor Chriſtians? If the king have not a negetive voyce, he hath noe voyce, &amp; every members of Parliament hath a voyce affirmative, &amp; negative, and they deny that to the king in denying his negative voyce, which they allow all, that have any voyce.</p>
               <p>He demaunds <hi>what was he himſelfe all this while, that we denyed it him, as a King.</hi> He had the freedome of his will, when he gave noe vote againſt it, but all the world ſayes that you were Traytours in the deniall. His naturall libertie of will was not taken from him by your Trayterous violence, though his right to vſe it in his kingly office were Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly withſtood. If a King be prohibited the vſe of his reaſon in his Government, he is denied that, which belongs to him as a man, and a Chriſtian, and theſe impudent Traytours are ſoe cauterized, that they ſcoffe at their Lewde villany aſking whether he did not enjoy the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of his will, when they had impriſoned, and depoſed him.</p>
               <p>He aſkes, <hi>might not the King have enjoyed both reaſon, and conſcience go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verninge vs as free men, by what lawes we our ſelves would be governed?</hi> And how could he governe, if you make the lawes, he might be governed? And who ſhall governe, when every man is a law-maker, and he could not enjoy reaſon, nor conſcience governing by lawes he approved not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was not the inward uſe of his reaſon, and conſcience, that would content him.</hi> Doubtles it ought not being a King, but ſayes he <hi>to vſe them both as a law over all his ſubjects in whatſoever he declared as a King to like, or diſlike.</hi> The King were noe King, if his ſubjects might make lawes without him, and his reaſon, and conſcience ought to be his lawes in governing, and he juſtly ſaid. <hi>It were better to be without the Title of King, if it ſhould carry with it ſuch a vaſſallage, as not to ſuffer him to vſe his reaſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in what he declared as a King to like, or diſlike</hi> which vſe of reaſon ſayes the libeller <hi>moſt reaſonles, and vnconſcionable is the vtmoſt, that any
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95058:77"/>Tyrant ever pretended over his vaſſalls.</hi> Tyrants were never eſteemed by their pretences, but by their Actions, &amp; it ſhewes that theſe men knew not, what Tyrany was, who make a juſt right of all Governours, the vſe of reaſon Tyrany, and that, which never king was thought fitt to be denyed, though Tyrants abuſed it. Tyrany is in the abuſe of power, not in the rule of Government.</p>

                  <hi>In all wiſe nations the Legiſlative power, and the judiciall execution of that power have been diſtinct.</hi> But never devided being allwayes ſubordinate one to the other, the judiciall execution depending on the Legiſlative.</p>
               <p>He makes an aſſumption, <hi>If then the king be only ſett vp to execute the law he ought noe more to make, or forbidd the making of any law, then other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Iudges.</hi> But if the king be ſet vp to make law by the advice of his Councell the Parliament, can they make lawes without him, but this Libeller, that would be thought ſoe ſtrong at Arguments, talkes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into contradictions, and allowes the king, neither the one power, nor the other, for he affirmes the king cannot judge, and make lawes he muſt not, and what will he conclude, ſure, that his owne nation is not wiſe, nor himſelfe honeſt, or rationall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He cannot reject a law offred him by the Commons, no more then make a law-which they reject.</hi> And hath it ſenſe, that becauſe a man cannot doe an Act without the advice of another, therefore he muſt doe what that other adviſes? The man dictates, and would be beleived, though the Commons never did, nor could offer a law to the king, for he wel knowes it muſt paſſe the Lords before it come to the king, but he was loath to mention the Lords, leaſt it ſhould cry downe the noyſe he hath made of the kings ſingle judgment, for the Lords houſe may not have a negative in his judgment, notwithſtanding their number. But why is it offred the king, if he may not reject it, and whence hath it been, that ſo many Bils have been rejected in al ages, without any complaint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When Kings come ſoe low as to fall vpon Philoſophy, which before he neither valued, nor vnderſtood is a ſigne they are then put to their laſt trump.</hi> If the king had not valued nor vnderſtood Philoſophy, he could not have made ſoe pertinent vſe of it, and if the Libeller had vnderſtood Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, or valued truth, he would have given better ſignes of it. Could not his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> 
                  <hi>diſcourſe of his reaſon, and will, but it muſt be out of the way, or above his abilities.</hi> But why is this a ſigne, that kings are then put to their trump, why the vſe of Philoſophy more then other, learning? Though kings come low, Rebells will come to ſeeke corners to hide themſelves. He ſhewes not how Philoſophy breakes the necke of their cauſe, or how he hath made advantage of Philoſophy againſt the king, but we finde how his elaborate contradictions, have broken the necke of his owne cauſe through out all his diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes he <hi>cannot thinke the Majest: of the Crowne of England to be bound by any Coronation oath in a blinde, and brutiſh formalitie to conſent to whatever its ſubjects in Parliament ſhall require.</hi> And ſayes the Libeller, <hi>What Tyrant could preſume to ſay more.</hi> And the law it ſelfe, Religion, and reaſon never ſaid leſſe.</p>

                  <hi>It cannot but be yeilded, that the oath, which bindes him to performance of his truſt, ought in reaſon to containe the ſumme of what his cheife truſt, and office is.</hi> But what if it doe not, is there an argument to be drawne from what the oath ought to be, but is not? The oath may containe the generall dutie of Juſtice, &amp; right, but it neither did, nor could comprehend all the wayes of effecting it.</p>
               <p>The libeller ſayes, that <hi>the Kings negative voyce is not contained in that oath.</hi> But that oath oblidges him to governe by juſt lawes, which comprehends a negative to all vnjuſt lawes, and can it impoſe an obligation vpon the king of doing Juſtice, and not give him a libertie of judging what is juſt, or vnjuſt?</p>
               <p>The Libeller ſayes, that <hi>his oath requires only his aſſent to thoſe lawes, which the people have already choſen, or ſhall chuſe,</hi> there is noe ſuch word in that oath, and his mention of the Lattine, and old Engliſh of that oath are of another ſenſe, &amp; that the libeller was conſcious of, &amp; therefore he ſayes. <hi>All reaſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, that the people ſhould not looſe vnder a new king what freedome they had before.</hi> but their freedome conſiſts not in an exemption from ſoveraigne power.

It is the nature of ſectaries to be wiſe in their owne conceite, and thence come arrogance, and contempt of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; it is a principall in their ſchiſme to improve this naturall inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and contemne all Eſtates, and abilities of men diſſenting from them, &amp; though his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> were of moſt eminent natural endowments this libeller cals him <hi>a man neither by nature, nor nurture wiſe.</hi> Which ſhewes he vnderſtood not wiſedome in others, nor was ſenſible of his owne folly ſoe apparent to all his readers.

The nature, and nurture of this libeller is diſobedience, and therefore will have the Kings wiſedome to be will, &amp; the Rebells raſhnes wiſedome, and it is impoſſible, that men, who have ſucked in ſuch principles ſhould ever be obedient to any Government, ſtudying only how they may diſaffect ſubjects to it.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>the Kings errour was imperious, and force was vſed not to diſpell errour out of his head, but to drive it from of our neckes.</hi> Theſe Rebells ſought to be imperious, &amp; put the yoke vpon the neckes of the people, and that, which reſtrained them from an abſolute arbitrary power, which was the Kings negative, they would take away by force, and place negative, and affirmative in themſelves. The libeller ſayes well that force was not vſed to diſpell errour, which was vſed to enforce conſent, and to make errour, and ſhewes their wickednes, that tooke that courſe.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>the vprightnes of his intention will excuſe the poſſible failings of his vnderſtanding, who ſeriouſly endeavours to ſee the beſt reaſon, &amp; faithfully followes it.

               <p>The king ſayes <hi>never thing pleaſed him more, then when his judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curd with theirs.</hi> The libeller to this ſayes. <hi>That was to the applauſe of his owne judgment, and would aſwell have pleaſed any ſelfe conceited man.</hi> But could the king deſpiſe the judgment of the Parliament, as this addle headed libeller continually exclaimes, and make it matter of applauſe to himſelfe, that his judgment concurd with theirs? Could he ſleight their judgment, and conceite his owne credited by their concurrence? If he had noe other eſteeme of their judgment, then the libeller would have beleived, doubtles he might have ſuſpected his owne Judgment, for concurring with theirs; And whence comes itt, that a ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited man would be ſoe well pleaſed with ſuch a concurrence? A ſelfe conceited man ſcornes the concurrence of other mens judgments, and preferrs his owne againſt all others, but reaſon cannot be expected from this man being vſe les to his vndertaking.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes <hi>in many things he choſe rather to deny himſelfe then them.</hi> And ſayes the libeller. <hi>That is to ſay Trifles, for of his owne intereſts, and perſonall rights he conceives himſelfe Maſter.</hi> And who can deny itt, but he is Maſter of them, and yet he hath parted with theſe, and could he part with any thing were of he was not Maſter?

Thoſe rights are in compatible with ſubjects, and inſeperable from Governours, and are noe more ſubordinate to the peoples good, then Juſtice, or law are, but they are the peoples good, and the people are ſubordinate to their Rulers in judging what is their good. But he muſt part with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Kingdome is greater then he, as the Libeller ſayes, That is noe reaſon, but it is according to the Rebells principles, that there is no right, but force, &amp; the weaker may not conteſt againſt the ſtronger.</p>
               <p>The libeller is very copious in his declamations againſt Monarchy, and it would be tedious to follow him in his verboſitie, he excepts to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95058:79"/>theſe words of the King. <hi>In what concernes truth, Iuſtice, the right of Church, or his Crouwne, noe man ſhall gaine his conſent againſt his minde.</hi> And ſayes the libeller. <hi>What can be left then for a Parliament, but to ſit like Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whileſt he aſſumes the beſt abilitie of judging, or reſtraynes all men from enjoyment of any good, which his judgment thinkes not fit to graunt them.</hi> And what were a King but an Image, if he were bound to graunt, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his ſubjects in Parliament demaund of him, and to what end doe they take an oath of Alleagiance, if he were bound to quit it, when they aſke it? And are there any ſoe ſunke in vnderſtanding, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, that it is the office of a King to judge of nothing, and the right of ſubjects in Parliament to commaund al things. But this man is of Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophells minde, that if his Councell be not followed, he will goe home, &amp; hang himſelfe. Advice from ſubjects to a King is ordained by law, but the ſubjection of a King to adviſe is monſtrous, and vnſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable. The Authors repetitions of rayling Epithites vpon what concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the King, or his Actions, &amp; commendation of the wicked Actions againſt him, will not alter the nature of one or other, and his vehement aſſeveration, that <hi>the law, and Coronall oath require the Kings vndeniable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to what lawes the Parliament agree vpon,</hi> is not out of opinion of truth, but the ſtrength of his language himſelfe ſhewing the contrary aſwell as the Parliament.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>he had rather weare a Crowne of thornes with our ſaviour, then to exchange that of gold for one of lead, whoſe imbaſt flexiblenes ſhalbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to binde, and comply to the various, &amp; oft contrary Dictates of any faction, when inſteede of reaſon, &amp; publique concernement they obtrude nothing, but what makes for the intereſt of parties, and flowes from the partialitie of private wills, &amp; paſſions.</hi> The libeller ſayes <hi>many would be all one with our ſaviour, whome he will not know. They who governe ill thoſe Kingdomes, which they have right to, have to our ſaviours Crowne of thornes noe right at all.</hi> Such as are Rebells to lawfull Princes, &amp; vſurpe Kingdomes, will never weare a Crowne of thornes with their ſaviour, nor can hope to be knowne by him, while they ſucke the blood of his anointed, and Tyranize over kingdomes ſoe wickedly gotten. That Crowne of thornes, which this libellers ſavage ſouldiers, and others ſet vpon the laſt king, is now his Crowne of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in heaven, &amp; honour among men, &amp; the infamy of theſe helliſh miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants. The libeller twiſts thornes, and ſnares for himſelfe by his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meles Calumnies, ſeeking to make the aſſaſſination of a gracious king his owne demeritts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Crowne of gold is not due to him, who cannot firſt weare a Crowne of lead, not only for the weight of that greate office, but for the compliance with them, who are to Councell him.</hi> A leaden Crowne may well expreſſe ſtupiditie, and baſenes, and the Crowne of gold better agrees with ſound Councell, which is compared to apples of gold in picture of ſilver, then lead which ſhewes only <hi>that imbaſt flexiblenes to the various, and oft contrary Dictates of any faction,</hi> and is only a weight of puniſhment, not of office,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95058:79"/>which the gold repreſents, but Traytours cannot endure a Crowne of gold vpon the head of their king, they will only allow him a Crowne of thornes, or lead.</p>
               <p>The libeller taxes the king <hi>for want of modeſtie, in imputing want of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and neglect of the publique, rather to the faction then to himſelfe, becauſe the faction was the Parliament.</hi> And he muſt be a man voyde of all modeſtie, that doth not judge ſuch Actions as the king complayned of <hi>to proceede from want of reaſon, &amp; negbect of the publique, intereſt of parties, &amp; partialities of private will, and paſſion.</hi> The ſectaries were wont to deprecate all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of irreverence to their King, and complaine, that they were wronged, but the queſtion is now changed, &amp; contempt of the King is their greate vertue. The libeller throughout this whole diſcourſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the conſideration of the Kings conſcience, &amp; heereto theſe words of the Kings <hi>I know noe reſolutions more worthy a Chriſtian King, then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his conſcience before, his Kingdomes,</hi> ſayes <hi>the ſentence is faire in ſeeming, but fallacious for the conſcience may be ill edified.</hi> And becauſe it may be ſoe, is it fallacious, that conſcience muſt be preferred before Kingdomes? Theſe hipocrites, that pretend to Rebel for their conſcience, accuſe the king for refuſing to paſſe a law, in regard of the contrary perſwaſion of his conſcience, and it muſt be an ill edified conſcience in him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare an act, &amp; a rightly informed conſcience in them; that commit an act ſo bloody, &amp; ſcandalous to the whole world, &amp; ſo dangerous to the ſoules of many, that were drawne headlong into that ſin, the Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot be preſerved without his negative voyce, and therefore he might juſtly aſſert it to be his right by law, &amp; when the libeller can perſwade men, that Parliaments are infallible, and free from faction, &amp; that Rebells are beſt judges, of what is for the Kingdomes good, he may hope to be beleived, that the king denyed that, which law, his oath, and office bid him graunt. And all men ſee, that vnder the name of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Parliament, Rebels have introduced their owne wils for lawes.</p>

Thoſe, that compelled the Queenes departure did more contribute to the diſhonour of a Proteſtant King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp; the Proteſtant Religion, whereof they take the name without the truth, then the greateſt Enemy to the Proteſtant Religion could have effected, what the caſe of her mother was wee enquire not, but the world ſees, that theis injuries to her <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> exceeded example, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells injuſtice fixes noe diſhonour, but on themſelves.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes <hi>this is the firſt example of any Proteſtant ſubjects, that have taken vp Armes againſt their King a Proteſtant.</hi> The Libeller ſayes <hi>it can be to Proteſtants noe diſhonour, when it ſhalbe heard, that he firſt leavied warr on them, and to the intereſt of Papiſts more then of Proteſtants.</hi> But then it is diſhonour, if he firſt leavied not warr vpon them? And all that reade his booke muſt conclude, that they firſt leavyed warr vpon him, what els doth he meane by defending the Tumults, ſeizing the forts, and Militia, rayſing an Army, &amp; vpbraiding the king with feares to hazard ſuch a ſcuffle. But were it otherwiſe, the Proteſtants have diſclaimed his Trayterous pretence of taking Armes againſt the King vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Religion, or otherwiſe, &amp; hold it diſhonour to their Religion, that ſuch Rebellious principles ſhould be charged vpon them, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more for the intereſt of Papiſts, then that Proteſtants ſhould maintaine, and practice that doctrine of Rebellion. The world is ſatisfied, how diſloyally the King was proſecuted by Armes, and had it been otherwiſe, ſubjects ought to petition not returne violence, and in all the excuſes that theſe Traytours have vſed, they never mention any offer of ſatisfaction to the King, or deſire to lay downe his Armes, but require his ſubmiſſion, and giving vp his rights, or otherwiſe they would take it by force. The precedence of the Scotts warr will not take of the diſhonour.</p>

               <p>He ſayes, <hi>Its a groundles, and diſſembled feare, that ſhee, that was for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares averſe to her husbands Religion ſhould be now the more alienated,</hi> &amp; can the Libeller deny, but that the averſion of any may be encreaſt, and confirmed by the wickednes of the perſons of the contrary Religion, how groundles then, and ſhameles is his exception?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the feare of her delinquencie, and Iuſtice demaunded on her, was any cauſe of her alienating the more, to have gained her by indirect meanes, had been no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Religion.</hi> As the King obſerved, that this was the firſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Proteſtant ſubjects, that tooke Armes againſt their king: ſoe this of charging the Queene with Delinquencie was the firſt example in that kinde, that trayterous impudence had produced, &amp; when it ſhalbe heard, that a compaine of ſuch vile perſons charge the Queene with Crymes fot aſſiſting her husband, they wilbe aſſured, that not feare of Delinquencie, but their barbarous crueltie might more alienate her, &amp; diſadvantage Religion. <hi>Them, who accuſed her</hi> he ſayes <hi>well enough knowne to be the Parliament, the King cenſures, for men yet to ſeeke their Religion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doctrine, diſcipline, or good manners.</hi> And ſoe doth the whole world, whatever name the Libeller give ſuch men, who are well enough knowne to be a Trayterous faction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The name of true Engliſh Proteſtants is a meere ſchiſmaticall name.</hi> And why? Are there not ſeverall confeſſions in the Proteſtant Churches, &amp; doe they hold one another Schiſmatickes for that reaſon? How often hath this Libeller named the beſt reformed Churches, is not that as much a name of ſchiſme? he is ignorant in the nature of ſchiſme, though he be ſoe well practiſed in it, and its ſtrange he would obſerve a Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall name from the title of a nation, and not from his title of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie, that produceth as many titles, and diſtinctions, as there be Pariſhes, or Parlours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King aſcribes rudenes, and barbaritie worſe then Indian to the Engliſh Parliament.</hi> To the Libellers Parliament he very well may. He ſayes <hi>the King aſcribes all vertues to his wife vndervaluing the greate Councell of his Kingdome in compariſon of one woman.</hi> And not only he, but all good men abominate that wicked Councell, which vſed ſuch rudenes, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie towards her, and from hence the Libeller tells vs <hi>there are examples of miſcheife vnder vxorious Magiſtrates, and Feminine vſurpation.</hi> And muſt Magiſtrates therefore have noe wives, or noe affections to them? And the examples of feminine vſurpation are more frequent in Republican Tribunes then Monarchs.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes, <hi>her tarrying heere he could not thinke ſafe among them, who were ſhaking hands with Allegiance to lay faſter hold on Religion.</hi> The Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſayes that <hi>he taxes them of a dutie rather then a Cryme, it being juſt to obey God rather then man.</hi> And is periury, and the breach of Alleagiance obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, and doe men obey God, that breake on Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon pretence to keepe another. The Scripture tells vs he that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95058:81"/>breakes one Commaundement is guiltie of all, but theſe are they, that ſay they love God, and yet hate their brother, hate and kill their King Gods vicegerent.</p>
               <p>The libeller ſayes <hi>it was the fault of their courage, that they had not quite ſhaken of, what they ſlood ſhaking hands with.</hi> Its like their conſcience, and Religion were not the cauſe they did not, but the Libeller was not of their Councell, for the time required they ſhould keepe their maske longer.</p>
               <p>He is offended at the Kings prayer, <hi>that the diſloyaltie of his proteſtant ſubjects may not be a hindrance to her love of the true Religion,</hi> and ſayes that <hi>he never prayes, that the diſſolutenes of his Court, the Scandalls of his Clergie, vnſoundnes of his owne judgment, Lukewarmenes of his life, letter of compliance to the Pope, permitting his nuntio heere, may not be found farr greater hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> All theſe put togeather are farr ſhort of the ſcandall of the diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie of his ſubjects. The Court diſſolutenes is made a common place of ſcandall, not veritie in reſpect of the application, there being not ſuch exceſſes in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Court, that deſerved a ſpeciall obſervation, and the reſtraint of diſſolutenes was more obſervable, then the Cryme. As to the ſcandalls of his Clergie, though we muſt beleive, that offences wil come, yet the ſcandall of the preſent diſloyaltie was more offenſive to thoſe of different Religion, then any diſorders in Civil converſation, and the injuſtice of the Rebells towards the Clergie, hath ſhewed the vntruth of the ſcandalls, that were caſt vpon them, &amp; though their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice traduced, &amp; perſecuted them, their proofes could not convict them of the ſcandall ſuppoſed. His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> owne judgment cannot be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt by a Rebells malice, and his examplary life cannot be ſtained by a Libellers pen. His letter to the Pope was noe complaince, nor could it give offence to proteſtant or hope to Papiſt, &amp; theſe Rebells, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with Turkes, and infidells leaſt of all thinke it a compliance. The Libeller well knowes there was noe nuntio in England, and if the King ſhould have denyed the Queene the exerciſe of her Religion, whereto he was bound by the Articles vpon the match, he had given greater ſcandall by breaking the Articles, then by permitting her the repaire of perſons in matters of her Religion. But ſayes the Libeller, <hi>they muſt not ſit ſtill,</hi> that is not Rebell, <hi>and ſee their Religion ſnatcht away</hi> But they have Rebelled to ſnatch away Religion. He ſayes, <hi>Its knowne, that her Religion wrought more vpon him, then his vpon her, and his favouring of Papiſts, and hatred of Puritans, made men ſuſpect ſhee had perverted him.</hi> Noe doubt ſuſpitions were induſtriouſly rayſed, and carrefully nouriſht againſt the King, though they beleived them not, that made vſe of them. The King was not bound to deſtroy all Papiſts, and could not deny them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a King, &amp; he had juſt reaſon to ſuſpect thoſe bloody Puritans, whoſe inclinations he deſcerned to that wickednes they have ſince avowed.</p>

               <p>From his ſuppoſitions he aſcends to his exclamations. <hi>What is it, that the blindenes of hipocriſie dare not doe? It dares pray, and thinke to hide that from the eyes of God, which it cannot from the open view of men.</hi> We finde this very frequent in this Author, and in this very Period, that in contempt of God, &amp; men, charges the King with Crymes he not only knew falſe, but which are ſoe knowne vnto the whole word, and conclude againſt his owne narrations, and others view.</p>

                  <hi>Its a ſtrange operation of ſorrow, that ſtirred him ſoe vehemently to have Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham puniſhed, and not to have him repent.</hi> But this exception is more ſtrange, that a man may not be vehement for the puniſhment of one, for whoſe offence he is greived, and there may be juſt cauſe of ſorrow, for an Act, which the repentance of the Actour cannott remedy. He knowes well how litle his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> was likely to worke vpon Hotham
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95058:83"/>at that time obſtinate, but it was a neceſſitie vpon his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that he ſhould be proceeded againſt injuſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There hath not been obſerved in the King a ſorrow for his owne ſins, nor for ſuch ſins of others, as cannot be ſuppoſed a direct injury to himſelfe.</hi> This man will not have the Kings ſorrow for his ſins obſerved, nor acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, wee have ſeene his malicious detractions of the Kings ſorrow for his conſent to the death of the Earle of Strafford, and it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from ſuch men, that they will give Teſtimony to any truth, that deny all evidence of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Kings labour to have the ſinner only puniſhed wilbe called revenge.</hi> And why? They pretended juſtice, not revenge that after cut of Sr. John Hothams head. May not a King doe juſtice without revenge? The jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in abettinge, &amp; protecting Sr. John Hotham at that time was the ground worke of the ſucceeding evills, and the ſame men, that denyed juſtice at his Maj: deſire tooke reveng of the ſame inſolencie afterward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hull was not the Kings owne towne, but the Kingdomes.</hi> And how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came they a Towne, have they not all their liberties, and graunts from the King? He might have ſaid that Townes vnder a popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were the peoples, but in a Kingdome, it is a fantaſticall dreame, &amp; the lawes deny a poſſibilitie of any ſuch propertie having placed the ſoveraigntie of the Kingdome in the King, &amp; ſuch a concluſion of right is inconſiſtent with a kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Armes</hi> he ſayes <hi>were publique Armes bought with publique money, or not his owne.</hi> If the king have money from the publique may they take it away againe, to what end then doe they give him ſubſidies, if the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney be ſtil their owne, and they may take away what is bought with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Had they been his owne, as much as the private houſe, and Armes of any man are his owne the law permitts not to vſe them in away not private, but ſuſpitious to the Commonwealth.</hi> If vulgar ſuſpition may checke publique imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he may not looke long to vſe any thing. And is it a cryme in the kinge to vſe his private wealth in a publique warr? No doubt, but his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> propertie is as much, as any private mans, els his kingly office had little honour, or ſtrength, and he is not accountable for the vſe, which he makes of his Eſtate either private, or publique, and there was noe feare of the vſe, that the king would make, but from Traytours, that would prevent his defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King by his overtalking ſeemes to doubt of beleife touching his patience at Hull.</hi> He expected not, nor valued the beleife of Traytours, but ſuch as ſoberly conſider what he ſayes, will not judge him over talking, but modeſtly expreſſing his owne temper, which endured ſoe high a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes <hi>he could not, but obſerve, how God not long after pleaded, and avenged his cauſe.</hi> The Libeller ſayes <hi>moſt men, and commonly the worſt are apt to interpret the judgments of God to the juſtifying of their owne cauſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:95058:83"/>Its poſſible the worſt men may doe ſoe, but we ſee it very frequent with the beſt. The Prophet David often taken notice of Gods dealing with his Enemies, &amp; wicked men. The Libeller might hence obſerve his Maſters, the worſt of men, that interpret, and expound the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and the event of providence to the juſtifing of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion how often hath he in this Libell taken vp that Argument, and in this very Chapter makes an obſervation of Gods Judgment vpon the King, from their murther of him before his owne Pallace gate. And how frequent are their ſucceſſes produced as profes of the goodnes of their cauſe, but this <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> obſervation is not grounded vpon the event, but the evident Cryme of Hotham, which all men held Treaſon, but ſuch, as would allow nothing to be Treaſon againſt the King. Although we know not the reaſons of Gods proceedings, who often leaves good men to ſuffer, and wicked men proſper, yet when we ſee the prime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of a wicked deſigne periſh by the hands of thoſe, whome he ſerved in his vnlawfull enterprize, we may juſtly take notice of the proportion betweene the ſin, and the puniſhment.</p>
               <p>His comparing Sauls conjecture of <hi>an advantage God had ſent him in Davids being at Keilah, hath noe</hi> reſemblance to the taking away of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thams life, Saul being not only deceived in the advantage, but conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of Gods disfavour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hotham was ſafe, and ſucceſſefull, while he continued true to the Parliament.</hi> But the guilt of his conſcience made him vnquiet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If God had purpoſed ſuch an end for his oppoſition to the King, he would not have deferred to puinſh him till of an Enemy he was made the Kings friend, nor have made his repentance the occaſion of his ruine.</hi> Theſe preſumptuous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells dare ſit in judgment vpon Gods wayes, and preſcribe a rule for his proceedings. Its true, becauſe judgment is not executed ſpeedily, the hearts of the children of men are ſet vpon evill, &amp; the Libeller judges, that if the judgments of God be not apparent in his time, that is foorth with, they are none at all. God brought his judgment vpon the ſon of Ahab, and not vpon himſelfe, becauſe he humbled himſelfe, and God puniſht the ſins of David vpon his poſteritie, though he forgave him, and we may conceive the judgment of God vpon a wicked Act, not the repentance of it, though it come after in time. Strafford Duke of Buckingham was an active aſſiſtant to Rich: the 3: in his vſurpation, and after revolting from him periſht by that power he had rayſed, which all men looke on as a judgment vpon his firſt compliance with that Tyrant, and the fate of Hotham, and that Duke hold greate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in regard of their Actions, and ſufferings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glorious deedes done to ambitious ends finde a reward ſutable.</hi> And that the Libeller might juſtly apply vnto Sr. Iohn Hotham, who made po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applauſe the end of his Treaſon, and periſht by popular fury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may heere take notice what tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes he had from the king for revolting to his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95058:84"/>cauſe.</hi> Repenting Traytours may have mercy, but they deſerve not thankes, &amp; though his puniſhment may be remitted, the infamy of his Act will ſurvive.</p>
               <p>Becauſe <hi>God judges not by humane fancie,</hi> therefore ſayes he <hi>ſuch events, as are obvious to every fancie, are moſt like to be erroneous.</hi> And then ſuch Acts of providence, as make men ſay ſurely there is a God, that jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the earth are moſt likely to be miſtaken. Although Common fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are likely to be deceived, it is a ſorry inference from thence, that what is obvious to every fancie weake, and wiſe, ſhould be more likely to be erroneous.</p>
               <p>The king ſoe farr pittied Hotham, as <hi>he thought he at firſt acted more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the light of his conſcience, then many other men, in the ſame cauſe.</hi> To this the Libeller ſayes. <hi>They who act againſt conſcience are leaſt of all to be pittied either at the Barr of humane, or divine Iuſtice.</hi> Deſperate ſinners, as moſt miſerable, are moſt to be pittied in Chriſtian Charitie, though ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice proceede more ſeverely againſt them, pitties are part of juſtice, the Libeller is acquainted only with the operations of malice, not of pittie, whereof his whole diſcourſe ſhewes him deſtitute, otherwiſe the kings pittie could not argue him <hi>deſtitute of the Common grounds of nature,</hi> as the Libeller inferrs, and ſhewes that he eſteemes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grounds of nature, Acts of Tyrany, and inſulation vpon others, ruine, hatred, and ſcorne being all the Charitie, that Sectaries practiſe.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>the king jerkes at ſome mens reforming to modells of Religion, and that they thinke, all is gold of pietie, that doth but gliſter with a ſhew of zeale.</hi> To this ſayes the Libeller. <hi>The pietie of his Prelacie modell, gliſtered more vpon the poſts, and pillars, which their Zeale, and fervencie guilded over, then in true workes of ſpirituall edification.</hi> The repairing, and beautifying of the houſes of God was the higheſt commendation of many of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Servants, and the Scripture gives that for the high commendation of the famous Jehojada, and we may expect ſpirituall edification from thoſe, whoſe zeale, &amp; fervencie carries them to beſtow their goods on ſuch Actions, nothing but deſtruction of Church, &amp; pietie from thoſe, that decry ſuch commendable, and neceſſary workes, &amp; we have found, that ſuch men, as have pretended to ſpirituall edification, by traducing other mens zeale in the outward ſervice of God, have proved at laſt rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Carkaſſes guilded over, and painted ſepulchers.</p>
               <p>He is ſorry, <hi>that Hotham felt the Iuſtice of others, and fell not rather in to the hands of his mercy.</hi> The libeller ſayes <hi>he ſhould have ſhewed, what mercie he had vſed to ſuch as fell into his hands.</hi> He needed not ſhew that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are ſoe many Examples.</p>
               <p>But ſayes the Libeller, <hi>whathever one man might have expected, the whole nation found none, but had been ſwallowed vp in blood, had not his power failed.</hi> What neede the King produce Examples of his mercy, when his moſt malicious Enemies offred nothing to the contrary, but the warr, which
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95058:84"/>they had neceſſitated him to make. There cannot be an Argument more convincing of the want of all juſtification in theſe Rebells, then their perpetuall recourſe to an incredible aſſertion, that the King cauſed the warr, which beſides the falſenes of the allegation is not of weight to argue want of mercy, when as Princes, and ſtates may caſually be engaged in a warr, and yet be farr from crueltie, or deſignes of revenge, and his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> knowne backwardnes to a warr, and moderation in it, ſhew his compaſſion as eminent to the publique, as particular perſons.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>Clemencie is a debt, which he ought to pay to thoſe, that crave it, ſince we pay not any thing to God for his mercies, but prayers, &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. This</hi> ſayes the Libeller <hi>hath ſound of gravitie, but the ſignificance of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pertinent.</hi> And yet it ſignifies, that we are to forgive others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God forgives vs. But ſayes the Libeller <hi>we ought by this reaſon as freely to pay all things to all men.</hi> Wee ought noe doubt freely to pay what is due to all men, but the Scripture more particularly requires Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cic, and forgivenes from vs in regard our ſelves have moſt neede of it from God, and the Libeller ſhewes a greate emptines of reaſon, that calls this an <hi>emptie ſentence,</hi> and vpon this occaſion to repeate the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>the kings dutie to the kingdome,</hi> when as he declares, that nothing, but the giving vp of his Crowne could be a diſcharge of his dutie, ſoe grave a judge is he of <hi>debts, and duties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King pitties Hotham, but aggravates rather then leſſens, or conceales his fault.</hi> Conceale, or leſſen it, he could not, aggravate he doth not, &amp; being a King his pittie ought not to deſtroy his judgment, nor deceive him in the offence of thoſe he pardons.</p>
               <p>If <hi>a reiterating judge be worſe then a Tormenter,</hi> a reiterating ſlanderer deſerves Torment. The mention of a malefactours offence, or repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a publique trangſgreſſion is farr from a Triumph, and as this Act of Hotham was a groundworke of infinite miſerie: ſoe his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> deepe ſenſe of the miſcheife of that fact, might reflect on it with ſerious obſervation, and pittie without any Triumph.</p>
               <p>He is angry that the king ſayes <hi>after times will diſpute; whether Hotham were more infamous at Hull, or at Tower hill.</hi> And ſayes <hi>what knew he of after times, and while he ſits judging the fate of that vnhappy father, and ſon, knew not, that the like attended him before his owne Pallace gate, and as litle knew, whether after times doe not reſerve a greater infamy to the ſtory of his life, and Raigne.</hi> The libeller well knew by the booke he ſeekes to anſweare, that his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> well knew the power, &amp; malice of his Enemies, while he wrote this, and that he expected they would ſhew their vtmoſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie to his honour, aſwell, as his life, but he was well aſſured their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, &amp; diſſoyaltie could not effect what their impietie deſigned, and as long as Religion, or reaſon inhabite the world, his ſtory cannot be blotted in after times, but it ſeemes the libeller is apprehenſive of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture infamy, though he thinke himſelfe aſſured of preſent power.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:95058:85"/>
               <p>He would ſeeme an Enemy <hi>to vaine repetitions in prayers,</hi> but its only of ſuch things, as Traytours will not pray for, otherwiſe there is large experience of the vaine babling of ſectaries in their prayers.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>its too preſumptious in a written, and publiſhed prayer to take it as a favour from God before he knew it was intended him.</hi> He knew God had brought a ſevere puniſhment vpon a knowne offence, and how could this be preſumption to mention it, in a publiſhed prayer, but how can the libeller call it <hi>the ſacrifie named by Eccleſiastes,</hi> that practiſes ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thankesgivings for ſucceſſes, when as the cauſe he maintaines, and proſecutes is ſoe notoriouſly wicked.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>Let not thy Iuſtice prevent the objects, and opportunities of my mercy</hi> The Libeller ſayes. <hi>To folly, or Blaſphemy, or both ſhall wee impute this, ſhall the Iuſtice of God give place, &amp; ſerve the mercies of a man? all other men, who know what they aſke deſire of God, that their doings may tend to his glory.</hi> And doth not he, that prayes he may be able to ſhew mercy to his Enemies, pray, that his Actions may tend to Gods glory, Is not God glorified in the mercies of men? Is not mercy in men a guift of God, and can this trifler pretend ſin in that prayer? which deſires of God, that his Juſtice may not prevent their mercie to their Enemies, May not men pray for their Enemies, pray to have judgments diverted from them, pray to have an occaſion to ſhew them mercy? But this libeller, that eſteemes ſoe litle to Blaſpheame is careles how falſely he charge it on others.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95058:85"/>to the Iron flaile, &amp; thoſe Armes which he cals defenſive were ſo apparently a Trayterous hiſtolitie, that the ends, which he aſſignes for them admit not the leaſt colour for the appellation of defenſive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King takes noe notice, that thoſe liſted about him were the beginners of theſe Tumults.</hi> Neither could he of ſoe ſtrange an imagination.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes <hi>his receſſe gave them confidence, that he might be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> The Libeller ſayes, <hi>other men ſuppoſed both that, and all things els, who knew him neither by nature warlike, nor experienced, nor fortunate, yet ſuch</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes he <hi>are readieſt to imbroyle others.</hi> How well he performes the firſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of his booke not to deſcant on the kings misfortunes his readers may heere ſee, that makes the kings misfortune his reproach, and a ground of their wicked confidence to Rebell againſt him, but that ſuch men are readieſt to imbroyle others is not ſoe certaine, but vndoubted they are not readieſt to imbroyle themſelves, and noe valour, nor expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, whereof his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> is wel knowne to have had a greate meaſure can ſtopp a ſlandrous tongue. The miſcheifes brought vpon his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> kingdomes ſprung from ſuch perſons, as ſought their advantage by ſuch broyles, which all men ſee the King could never expect.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>he had a ſoule invincible.</hi> And the Libeller ſayes, <hi>what prayſe is that? the vnteachable man hath a ſoule to all reaſon invincible.</hi> And is an invincible courage noe prayſe? He ſeekes to ſhew his witt by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying invincible to vnteachable, when as if he had cited the Kings next words, as he ought, he had loſt his jeſt, for the King ſayes, he <hi>had a ſoule invincible through Gods grace enabling him,</hi> but he breaketh ſentences, and truth, leaſt he ſhould breake for want of matter.</p>
               <p>That the King labours <hi>to have it thought, that his fearing God more then man was the ground of his ſufferings.</hi> The Libeller ſayes, <hi>he pretended to feare God more then the Parliament, who never vrged him to doe otherwiſe.</hi> And did they not vrge him to doe otherwiſe, when they vrged him to doe that, which was againſt his conſcience? But there neede not more be ſpoken of this, for the Libeller calls that a narrow conſcience, which will not follow a multitude againſt its owne perſwaſion.</p>
               <p>He ſhewes his levitie beyound that Creature he calls the vulgar, who now affirmes the King was <hi>drawne by his Courtiers, and Biſhopps,</hi> and yet in the beginning of his booke he ſayes, that <hi>the diſcourſes, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Courtiers, and Prelates againſt the Parliament was but a Copy taken from his owne words, and Actions, that all remiſſenes in Religion iſſued origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from his owne authoritie, all miſcarriages in ſtate may be imputed to noe other perſon cheifely then to himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He goes on to compare the words of <hi>Saul, that he had performed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God to the Kings mention of his fearing God, &amp; the kings vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Prelates, againſt the advice of the Parliament, &amp; example of al refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, is not much vnlike, if not much worſe,</hi> noe neerer like, then this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors writings to modeſtie, &amp; loyaltie. Is the advice of the Parliament,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95058:86"/>and the example of all reformations equall to the expreſſe Commaund of God? The examples of all Reformations, himſelfe tells afterward are not concurrent in the matter he mentions, and if they were ſoe, are all points of reformation equally neceſſary, and of the ſame obligation with the commaund of God? and was the Reformation of the Church of England noe reformation? Why then doth he ſay all Reformation? And is not the Church of England equall, if not ſuperiour to any part of the world, that hath reformed? But we ſee what account theſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites make of the Example of all Reformation, that have ſet vp ſchiſmaticall confuſions of Religion in contempt of all Reformation. His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> did noe more in vpholding the Prelates, then what the example of the moſt primitive times, Godly Emperours, &amp; holy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs inſtructed him in, which noe Reformation ever contradicted, and he had no reaſon to hearken to the advice of ſuch, as then called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Parliament, who had broken and the lawes, and priviledges of Parliament, expelled the members, and were governed by Tumults, &amp; a company of Bedlam Sectaries againſt de doctrine, and practice of the vinverſall Church. The practice of Saul in perſecuting David wel ſutes with the courſe of theſe Rebells, but they have gone beyound him in malice, and diſobedience in the matter both of David, and alſoe the Amalekites, he brake the Commaundement of God in ſparing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleke, theſe traytours preſumptuouſly breake the Commaund of God in deſtroying their King, &amp; Church. And this man exceedes Sauls pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that makes the preſervation of an order continued in the Church in all ages as bad, or worſe, then the ſin of Saul.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>acts of grace are proud, vnſelfe knowing words in the mouth of any King, who affects not to be a God.</hi> Certainly this Libellers words ſhew him not only in affection, but in Act a proud vnſelfe knowing man. Are there noe Acts of favour, noe Acts of mercy in Kings, but all of neceſſitie, but enough hath been ſaid to theſe braineſicke dreames.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Never King was leſſe in danger of violence from his ſubjects, till he vnſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed his ſword, nay long after, when he had ſpilt the blood of thouſands, they had ſtill his perſon in a fooliſh veneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Should a Chriſtian cal that, which God Commaunded, &amp; David practiſed fooliſh veneration, but they whoſe wiſedome is Rebellion, hold Divine wiſedome fooliſhnes. And was he in ſo litle danger from thoſe, that held that veneration fooliſh, were there none, that held ſoe, when they affronted him, and threatned him every day? To what end ſhould multitudes come about his Pallace, and cry Juſtice, when they ſought murder? What would they have done if he had denyed their demaunds, ſhall we beleive they intended noe violence, or ſhall wee beleive, that they, who had ſeiſed the forts, and navy, and vſurpt the Government would have uſed noe violence to his perſon, when they had him, if he plyed not with them? Its true ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were not wholy vnſhamed at the firſt, but the malice, and ambition
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95058:86"/>of others was ſufficiently confirmed, and the multitude eaſily falls by Example.</p>
               <p>The King complaines, <hi>that Civill warr muſt be the fruites of his ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares raigning with ſuch a meaſure of Iuſtice, peace plentie, and Religion, as all nations either admired or envyed.</hi> The Libeller ſayes <hi>for Iuſtice let the Councell table, ſtarr Chamber, and high Commiſſion ſpeake the prayſe of it.</hi> Wee may be aſſured that malefactours will never prayſe Court of juſtice, we know Sectaries, and ſeducers hated the high Commiſſion, and ſeditious Libellers the ſtarr chamber, &amp; conſpiratours, &amp; incendiaries the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of Kings, and there were noe Acts paſt in theſe places of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as the meaſure of juſtice, which he enjoyed was not admired, or envyed by all nations.</p>
               <p>His mention of <hi>aboliſhing Parliaments</hi> detracts not from the meaſure of juſtice, peace, plentie, and Religion, &amp; we have found what injuſtice hath ſucceeded.</p>

               <p>He ſayes <hi>what peace was that, which drew out the Engliſh to a needeles, and diſhonourable voyage againſt the ſpaniards at Cades.</hi> It was that peace the Parliament deſired, and if the voyage proved ſucceſſeles his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> by preventing further danger, and preſerving peace notwithſtanding the miſcarriage (which muſt be the diſhonour only of the managers) ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teſtifies how wel he deſerved of his people for the continuance of their peace, and ſafetie.</p>
               <p>He askes next <hi>what that was, which lent our, ſhipping to a Treacherous, and Antichriſtian warr againſt the poore Proteſtants of Rochell.</hi> What is this againſt our peace at home, and though there were ſhipps of ours vſed againſt Rochel, tis ſufficiently knowne they were not lent againſt Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hell, and the Dutch ſhipps, which were vſed, as ours were not lent to a Treacherous, and Antichriſtian warr.</p>
               <p>He askes <hi>what peace was that, which fell to robb the french by ſea to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring all our marchants in that Kingdome.</hi> Is not this man madd, that will charge the vſe of the ſhipping againſt Rochell for a Cryme, and call it a Treacherous, and Antichriſtian warr, and preſently charge the King for making warr againſt the french, vpon the ground of vſing his ſhipps againſt Rochell, and call it a robbing of the french by ſea, and is it poſſible to avoyde the loſſe of Marchants in caſe of hoſtilitie?</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:95058:87"/>
               <p>He proceedes to cry out <hi>on that vnbleſt expedition to the Iſle of Ree doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whether more calamitous in the ſucces, or deſigne.</hi> Was not the deſigne in the favour of Rochell, did they not deſire it? and yet he calls the ill ſucceſſe of that Action <hi>the betraying all the flower of our military youth, and beſt Commaunders to a ſhamefull ſurpriſall, and execution.</hi> And who betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and to what purpoſe, what advantage could his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> have by ſuch a loſſe? And was the warr againſt Rochell Treacherous, and Antichriſtian, and the releife too? But this Libeller is reſolute to defie ſence, and reaſon, &amp; now he hath ſpoken againſt the peace we enjoyed, whereto doth it amount, was there any interruption of our peace at home, and was there not cauſe for theſe expeditions abroade, If there were not the Parliament failed in their Councell to the King in advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the warr with ſpaine, and complaining of the french for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imployment of the ſhipps againſt Rochell?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If peace were intended vs at home, what meant theſe billetted ſouldiers in all parts of the Kingdome.</hi> Doth noth he know the meaning, that mentions Cades, and the Iſle of Ree, where they were imployed, ſurely he is ſoe intent on words, as he looſes his Memory, aſwell as his other faculties.</p>
               <p>But he hath found out a deſigne <hi>of German horſe to ſubdue vs in our peacefull houſes.</hi> Theſe German horſe have made much noyſe, &amp; yet were never diſcovered, and the King, who was adviſed to make a warr in Germany, and other places by the Parliament could not vſe German horſe, but againſt England. But what is all this to the greate meaſure of peace we enjoyed above other nations. Can any man, that reades this Libellers willfull impertinency judge other, then that he fights blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, who would extend theſe forraigne voyages, which had not the face of warr at home, and continved not beyound the fower firſt yeares of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> Raigne, to diminiſh the meaſure of our peace ſoe long enjoyed, and that in the middeſt of ſoe many miſcarriages, and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies both at home, and abroade.</p>

                  <hi>For our Religion</hi> he ſayes, <hi>where was there a more ignorant, prophane, and vitious Clergie learned only in the antiquitie of their pride.</hi> The pride of theſe Sectaries contemnes all learning, &amp; antiquitie, which condemnes their fanctaſticall, &amp; preſumptuous novelezing. The learning of the Engliſh Clergie is too well knowne to the world to receive any diſreput from the Streechinge of night oules, and of Kats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Noe wiſe man could ſee, what was left for other nations to admire or envie, but to pittie.</hi> Other nations ſaw who had enough to cauſe them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire our happines, not to pittie our condition, and of this there is a large Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>But ſayes the libeller, <hi>wealth, and plentie in a land, where Iuſtice Raignes not is no Argument of a floriſhing ſtate, but of neerenes rather to ruine, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</hi> The bleſſings of God, peace, and plentie are often turned into
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95058:87"/>wantonneſſe, and wickednes by the people, and are often a ſigne by the peoples abuſe of enſuing ruine, or commotion, and of this the preſent condition of England is a greate Teſtimonie, but it was never denyed, to be the floriſhing ſtate of any nation, and he will finde litle creditt to his ſuppoſition, that Juſtice Raignes not, where there is wealth, and plentie in a land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There were not ſome miſcarriages only of Government, which might eſcape.</hi> And of that nature are all the particulars gathred by him, if they had been true, <hi>but an viniverſall diſtemper, and reducement to arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> There was a diſtemper, and diſaffection to Government in many ſeditious ſeducers, but an viniverſall diſtemper, and reducement to Arbitrary Government could not conſiſt with the oppreſſion of that tranquillitie, and ſecuritie of the people, which was viſible to all men, the loſſe whereof brought on by theſe Rebells is too late lamemted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That his Majeeſt: owned the Actions, and protected the perſons of men in higheſt favour with him</hi> is noe argument of this vinverſall diſtemper, no more then the vulgar cryes againſt rulers is an Argument of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, or the peoples moderation, who will have perſons removed from Government, and yet not agree, who ſhall ſucceede them. It was an Argument of greate diſtemper in a people, that cryed out againſt the Kings evill Councellours, that could not judge of their Actions, but of noe vinverſall diſtemper in the Government, neither could the king with pietie, &amp; juſtice leave his Miniſters to the malice of conſpiratours and barbaritie of Tumults.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes, <hi>whoſe innocent blood hath he ſhedd, what widdowes, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans teares can wittnes against him?</hi> The Libeller thinkes he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an anſweare by ſaying <hi>the ſuſpected poyſonnig of his Father not enquired into, and he advanced, who was aceuſed by Parliament to be Author of the fact, and many yeares of cruell warr on his people in three Kingdomes.</hi> It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to amazement, that ſuch, whoſe language hath noe Limits of truth, or modeſtie ſhould not be able to forge a probable Calumnie, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Parliament ſhew, that noe man was accuſed for the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoninge of the kings Father, nor poyſoninge named, ct the fact was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquired into, and all wittneſſes examined, that had any knowledge of Circumſtances touching it, and muſt this be the particular to prove the king guiltie, of ſhedding blood? We may ſee vpon what grounds they will draw blood, that offer ſuch pretences for taking the blood of their king. Is it poſſible, that a Tyrant in ſeventeene yeares Raigne could not be proved guiltie of the blood of one man? And can a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion be more apparently convinced, then by the ſeeking a cauſe for it from the reſiſtance, that is made againſt it, and the endeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it? Was ever a cauſe ſoe barren of excuſe, that had nothing, but its owne guilt for defence?</p>
               <p>But he hath found out <hi>a ſcotchman, not vnacquainted</hi> he ſayes <hi>with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95058:88"/>the affaires, who affirmes, that there hath been more Chriſtian blood ſhed by the Commiſſion, approbation, and connivance of King Charles, and his Father Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, in the latter end of their Raigne, then in the ten Roman Perſecutions.</hi> And is not this a doughtie authoritie, what could he ſay more to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a falſe varlett? Whoever ſaw, or heard of this ſhedding of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an blood, is it poſſible, that ſoe much blood ſhould be ſhed, and noe man know it, but this Scotchman? Was all the world ſoe negligent to take notice of it, and did the Scotchman, and this Author thinke, that the blood of the late warr made vp this number, they may then expect vengeance vpon themſelves, and their bloody crew for it, either heere, or heereafter. They value ſuch, as ſuffred in the ten perſecutions at the ſame rate they doe their King, and their conſcience, and if they though perſecution odious, why doe they exerciſe a perſecution vppon Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians as cruell, as theſe perſecuting Emperours?</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>not to ſpeake of thoſe many whippings, and other corporall inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherewith his Raigne alſoe before this warr was not vnbloody.</hi> And is a Raigne bloody by inflicting death vpon robbers, and murtherers, or whipping, and the Pillory vpon, Cheates Infamous Libellers, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious diſturbers of Government, but of theſe latter the number was very ſmall not exceeding fower in ſeventeene yeares, and theſe merited the puniſhment they had, &amp; an higher had not exceeded their crymes. Is the execution of law a bloody Raigne, he findes none, that ſuffred <hi>baniſhment,</hi> nor any that died <hi>in priſon,</hi> but ſuch as were reſtrained by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Juſtice.</p>
               <p>He cannot pretend <hi>an arbitrary power</hi> in any of this, that <hi>the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested the true Church</hi> is noe other language, then what good Princes all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes received from Sectaries, who accuſe allwayes for their reſtraint, infeſting the true Church, but all men now ſee they are the malignant Compamy that infeſt the true Church, &amp; the ſeducers of ſimple ſoules.</p>
               <p>But he hath a proofe of blood above exception, where no blood was drawne, and that is <hi>the ſix members, whome all men judged to have eſcaped no leſſe then Capitall danger.</hi> Doubtles they had merited Capitall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the judgment of all knowing men. That a juſt King may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended for the eſcape of malefactours is eaſily beleived, but that ſaying <hi>the birds are flowne</hi> argues much trouble is a ſecret to all men, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe as often applyed in jeſt, as earneſt.</p>
               <p>The libeller ſayes, <hi>that if ſome vulter in the mountaines could have ſpake, he could not have vttered fitter words at the loſſe of his prey.</hi> The exceſſes in blood, and crueltie of theis Rebells cannot be expreſſed to the full, by the ſavage nature of any Creature. The grinning of doggs howling of wolves, and hiſſing of Serpents are not more hideous to nature, then the petulence of vile perſons againſt kings are abominable to Religion, and pietie.</p>
               <p>Becauſe Nero was vnwilling to ſett his hand to the execution of a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95058:88"/>Common Malefactour, and <hi>wiſhing he had not knowne letters</hi> he would prove the King proſecuting Traytours to have noe greate averſation to blood, but it ſtrongly proves a bloody conſpiracie, when the contrivers are held innocent, and the King made the offender for ſeeking juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and the Triumphs of ſuch, as protected thoſe perſons, and their impudent braving the King at his very doores argued their haſte to the ſhedding of that blood, which ſince hath covered the Land.</p>
               <p>Touching the cauſe of the warr, the King ſayes, <hi>It was not my with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from whitehall, for noe account in reaſon could be given of thoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, where an orderly guard was graunted.</hi> The libeller ſayes, <hi>that if it be a moſt certaine truth, that the Parliament could never obtaine any guard fit to be confided in, then ſome account of theſe pretended Tumults may in reaſon be given.</hi> But if they be not only pretended, but apparently Tumults, there can be noe account given of them, at leaſt the libeller vndertakes it not, and that they could not obtaine a guard fit to be confided in, is falſe, for they had a guard, and Commaunder of their owne nomination, though not the Earle of Eſſex.</p>
               <p>The King aſkes, <hi>whome did he protect againſt the Iuſtice of Parliament.</hi> The Libeller ſayes <hi>he endeavoured to reſcue Strafford,</hi> that was from their injuſtice, if he had done ſoe.</p>
               <p>But ſayes the Libeller he endeavoured it, though <hi>with the deſtruction of them, and the Cittie, commaunding admittance of new ſouldiers into the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</hi> And is it a neceſſary conſequent, that the admittance of new ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers into the Tower were to the <hi>deſtruction of Parliament, and Citie.</hi> But did not ſuch, as like blood hounds, &amp; wolves hunted the Earle of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, that they might not looſe their prey, and the ſweetenes of their revenge in drinking his blood, ſtirr vp the Tumults to the deſtruction of King, Parliament, and Kingdome?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What can be diſputed with ſuch a King, in whoſe mouth, &amp; opinion the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it ſelfe was never but a faction, and their Iuſtice noe Iuſtice, but the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, and overſwaying inſolence of Tumults, and rabbles.</hi> The Parliament was never a faction in the Kings mouth, but it is in every mans mouth, that the Parliament hath been overſwayed by a faction, and a faction have called themſelves the Parliament. And how can the Libeller define a Parliament, but he muſt acknowledge that thoſe, whome the King calls a faction were noe Parliament, and that their Actions were noe Juſtice, but the Dictates, and overſwaying inſolence of Tumults, and rabbles? himſelfe prooves it by the commendation he gives the Tumults, for effecting theſe Acts, which he now calls the Juſtice of the Parliament, &amp; noe wiſe man could thinke ſuch a rabble fit to Judge of Delinquents, or that ſuch men, who fled from their fury were thereby culpable of the Crymes objected, and the faireſt Tryall would ſooner have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, theſe Tumultuous accuſers then the parties accuſed. But who can talke with ſuch a man, as this breaker, that reputes Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95058:89"/>Tyrany, order in the Church an impoſed Religion, and lawes worſe then Ceremonies in Religion.</p>
               <p>He compares <hi>the avoyding of his madd Iudicature to Catilnies flight, and excepting to the Roman Senate, and Ceſars injecting ſcrupulous demurrs againſt the Decres of the ſenate vpon Lentulus, and Cethegus.</hi> But did either of them object, that the power of Tumults overſwayed the ſenate, or that the ſenate wanted freedome, and had oppreſſed the members of its? If Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline had ſet vp a ſenate as Caeſar did afterward, and theſe Rebells have in England, &amp; oppreſſed the legal Government, the exceptions had been very juſt, but exceptions againſt particular ſenatours for private animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities cannot derogate from the judgment of the whole being free.</p>
               <p>That <hi>ſuch reaſons were vrged for Strafford,</hi> was never heard at his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or other proceedings againſt him the caſes being contrary, for Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus, and the reſt were accuſed for conſpiring againſt the ſtate, &amp; Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford was accuſed by thoſe, that conſpired againſt the ſtate, and ſought to take him away for a cleerer paſſage to their deſigne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King vouchſafes, to the Reformation, which both Kingdomes intended noe better name then innovation, and ruine both to Church, and ſtate, and the expelling of Biſhopps out of the Church, ruine to the Church, and out of the houſe of Peeres ruine to the ſtate.</hi> And he aſkes <hi>how happy the nation could be in ſuch a governour, who counted that their ruine, which they thought their deliverance.</hi> It cannot be doubted, but the abolition of the order, and Government of Church and ſtate, is an innovation, &amp; performed by force againſt the King, execrable Rebellion, and the King never doubted to ſay, that ſuch diſorderly innovations were the ruine of Church, and ſtate, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, and ruines mentioned by the King to be agitated by ſome men are not reſtrained to the cauſe of the Biſhopps, though that alone, and the manner of proceeding in regard of the injuſtice, violence, and the dangerous conſequences, that attend it, threatned ruine to Church, and ſtate. It is ſtrange, that a people may miſtake their ruine for their deliverance, &amp; that a wiſe Prince by denying them their wil may keepe them from periſhing, which their owne errours would caſt them into, but ſuch, as knew how ſmall a part of the people, &amp; how contemptible, affected thoſe innovations, and how they were cheriſht by the leaders of Rebellion to ſtrengthen their partie, and how others were drawne in by hopes, and feares, to comply with a potent faction for their profit, or ſafetie, and how greate a partie both for number, &amp; qualitie deteſted theſe innovations may well conclude that neither the nation thought it their deliverance, nor the Kings refuſall other, then a juſt care, and providence for their good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not likely, that the houſe of Peeres gave hardly their conſent to the Bills againſt the Biſhops, that ſoe eaſily gave it to attach them of high Treaſon.</hi> But it is apparent they hardly gave their conſent to thoſe Bills, for they had often rejected them, and therefore his preſumption is of noe weight againſt plaine proofe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>If their rights, and priviledges were thought ſo vndoubted in that houſe, then was that proteſtation noe Treaſon, and the houſe will become liable to a juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction either of injuſtice for ſoe conſenting, or of vſurpation to expect, that their voting, or not voting ſhould obſtruct the Commons.</hi> The priviledges of the Biſhopps had they not been vndoubted, they needed not, an Act of Parliament, nor ſoe many Acts of violence to take them away, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the Commons pretend to greater right for their ſitting in the one houſe, then the Biſhopps in the other, and the Libeller hath right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded, that their proteſtation was noe Treaſon, but that their accuſation by the houſe of Commons was a falſe, and vngrounded Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and their commitment by the Lords houſe an odious injuſtice, but it could be noe vſurpation to expect, that their voting, or not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was concluſive to the Commons. To what end did the Commons offer their accuſation to the Lords, if their voting, or not voting were not conſiderable. It is Juſtice, when they concurre, &amp; vſurpation when they diſſent? But Lords houſe, &amp; Commons houſe are vſurpers, when they obſtruct the Dictates, and overſwaying inſolence of rabbles, and Tumults.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Commons were not to deſiſt for five repulſes of the Lords, noe not for fiftie from what in the name of the Kingdome they had demaunded, ſoe long as thoſe Lords were none of our Lords,</hi> and what if they had been your Lords, were they then to deſiſt, if ſo, it was more then they would doe to their King, but our, or not our makes noe difference to reſolute Traytours. The Lords were ſoe farr their Lords, as they were not to perſiſt by the power, wherewith they were intruſted for the kingdome in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund after the Lords refuſall, for to what end hath the law ordained a Lords houſe, and the Commons ſoe long practiſed their addreſſes to them, if they may doe what they pleaſe without them? Doth the vſe of the name of the kingdome add any right to them, that have not the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the kingdome, and demaund things to the deſtruction of the kingdome? The king allowes not ſuch a faction the name of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which hath nothing of either houſe, but ſome members, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the name without the priviledges, and authoritie, that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though the Bill againſt roote, and branch paſſed not till many of the Lords with ſome few of the Commons, either enticed away by the king, or overawed by the ſenſe of their owne malignitie deſerted the Parliament, that was noe warrant for them, who remained being farr the greater number to lay aſide the Bill.</hi> He well knowes they, that remained of the Lords houſe were an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number, and ſuch, as deſerted the Commons houſe wanted not many of the number of them, that remained, and of them, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained many were overawed by force, and diverſe plainely diſſented to that Bill.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95058:90"/>injured by the Tumults, and it was a moſt perfidious Act in them to enforce their members to deſert the houſe, that they might exerciſe their Arbitrary power over the kingdome, the injury was ſo apparent, &amp; the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of malignancie ſo ridiculous againſt the deſerting mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that noe ſober man can imagnie enticement, or overawing to be the cauſe of their withdrawing, and theſe remaining members ought to have forborne by their dutie to the kingdome, the paſſing of ſuch a Bil in the abſence of ſoe many members, but they, that will forbeare noe degree of treaſon cannot probably abſtaine from breakes of priviledge, and leſſe injuries.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>this degrading of the Biſhopps was orthodoxall in the Church an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and reformed.</hi> What will not this man ſay?

               <p>The King ſayes <hi>he was bound beſides his judgment by a moſt ſtrict, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable oath to preſerve that order, and the rights of the Church.</hi> And ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes the Libeller. <hi>If the letter of that oath be not interpreted by equitie, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or better knowledge, then was the King bound to graunt the Clergie all priviledges graunted to them by Edward the Confeſſour, and ſo bring in Popery.</hi> Equitie muſt be admitted in all interpretations of oaths, and ſoe muſt better knowledges, but the knowledge of other men is noe expoſition to him, that takes an oath, if his owne knowledge be not convinced. The King hath ſworne to preſerve the priviledges of the Church, to be a protectour of the Biſhopps, and by what equitie, reformation, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge would this libeller induce the King to breake this oath? If Sectaries ſay the calling is vnlawful againſt the judgment of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church, muſt the king believe this, &amp; thinke himſelfe abſolved of his oath? The King never doubted, that his oath could not binde him to ſin, but he was aſſured, that it was a ſin to breake his oath, when it was no ſin to keepe it, and while his conſcience was not informed of any vnlawfulnes in the matter of his oath, his ſin muſt be the more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to act againſt his oath, aſwell as his knowledge.</p>
               <p>The Libeller talkes <hi>of lawes of God, and truth of the Goſpell.</hi> But his ſchiſmaticall fancies muſt over rule lawes, and oath, &amp; though <hi>the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours, or other Kings had noe cauſe to leavy warrs vpon Proteſtant ſubjects vnder colour of a blinde, and literall obſervance to an oath,</hi> it had been a wickednes in their ſubjects to make a warr on them to compell them to breake that oath.</p>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95058:90"/>in this Kingdome, neither is the king bound to vphold it, as a thing eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</hi> Certainly lawes are very vainely ſaid to be made by the King, if he have no voyce in the making of them, and if they may be vneſtabliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed without him, and it was a wickednes, aſwell, as weakenes to binde him to vphold lawes, and to governe his people juſtly, that had not ſoe much as voyce in the making of their lawes, &amp; that was bound to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne by wicked lawes, if the Parliament would have them, ſuch Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary powers cannot conſiſt with Religion, law, nor reaſon in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of England.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>had he gratified, he thinkes, their Antiepiſconall faction with his conſent, and ſacrifiſed the Church Government, and Revenues to the fury of their Covetuouſnes, they would then have found noe colourable neceſſitie of rayſing an Army.</hi> The Libeller to this ſayes. <hi>It was the fury of his owne hatred to the profeſſours of the true Religion, which incited him to perſecute them with the ſword of warr, when whipps pillories, exiles, and impriſonments were not thought ſufficient.</hi> Its certen ſuch a generation of Traytours, as have perſecuted the King with a warr, juſtly merited to be whipt out of all Kingdomes, and while this Libeller frequently ſports at the Kings ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, he is not aſhamed preſently to call the warr voluntary on his part. If the Kings fury incited him to a warr, he would not ſoe often have ſought peace, nor been denyed peace without the ſacrifice of the Church.</p>
               <p>But the Libeller ſayes <hi>to colour this warr the King cannot finde where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all, but that ſtale pretence of Charles the fifth, and other Popiſh Kings, that the Proteſtants had only an intent to lay hands on the Church Revenues.</hi> The King neede not a colour for making a warr, whereto neceſſitie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced him. It is apparent, that the ſectaries in England intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure theſe Revenues, and have effected it, and they profeſſe to ſeeke it by the ſword, becauſe they could not have it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But the Libeller ſayes, <hi>it was never in the thoughts of the Parliament till exhauſted by warr, their neceſſitie ſeized on that for the Commonwealth, which the Luxury of the Prelates had abuſed to Common miſcheife.</hi> They neede not have been exhauſted, if reaſon, Juſtice, or Religion could have conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. They will make a warr, and robb, and ſteale from other men to maintaine it. Did not their pretended neceſſitie come from their warr to take away Epiſcopacy, and is not the neceſſitie of their owne making to get theſe Revenues? What if goods dedicated to Gods ſervice were abuſed to luxury, were there none els in the Kingdome ſoe abuſed? Muſt they make choiſe of the Patrimony of the Church for a ſacrifice to their Covetuouſnes, that they may ſpare their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate?</p>
               <p>That <hi>the King conſented to the vnlording of Biſhopps at Canterbury the cheife ſeate of their pride, for God would have it ſoe.</hi> And can he tax the King for his alluſions vpon the fate of Hotham, and obſerring the courſe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95058:91"/>of Gods judgments, and himſelfe make ſuch an obſervation from the Kings paſſing the Bill at Canterbury? May it not be an aggravation of the offence in paſſing the Bill there, rather then a puniſhment vpon thoſe, that were wronged by it, but Canterbury had not relation to their peace in Parliament, but in Church, and therefore his ſcene is miſlayed.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>his conſent to that Bill of putting Biſhopps out of the houſe of Peeres was from his firme perſwaſion of their contentednes to ſuffer a preſent diminution of their rights.</hi> The Libeller from hence argues <hi>the pure moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery of a Royall aſſent to delude for the preſent.</hi> May not ſober times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke what diſtempered madnes had neceſſitated, and had not the King juſt cauſe to thinke, that after times would ſee the obliqutie of that Bill?</p>
               <p>The Libellers conſequence is <hi>that we may hence perceive the wiſedome, and integritie of thoſe votes, which voted his conſeſſions at the Iſle of weight for grounds of a laſting peace.</hi> And why might they not be ſoe, though ſome of them might not be thought fitt to laſt long? And that by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both King, and houſes? But what were they, that voted, were they not the Libellers Parliament, in whoſe behalfe he hath ſoe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten expreſſed his anger for the Kings diſeſteeme of them, and calling them a faction, and now will have neither wiſedome, nor integritie in them?</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>from the kings profeſſing the continuance of his judgment touching Epiſcopacy, there is a faire juſtification of the Parliament, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his obſtinate minde omitted not meanes, and patience to have gained him.</hi> They omitted not reproach, and violence, but other meanes, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience they vſed not, and the Libeller hath contrived a conviction of his Parliament, that their not gaining his conſent to their demaunds was the cauſe of their warr, which he hold juſtified by the Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued averſion.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>a greate ſhew of delinquents was made, which were but conſequences of his, and others withdrawing, or defence.</hi> This ſayes the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller is <hi>a prettie ſhift to mince the name of a delinquent into a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent.</hi> It is injuſtice to make the name of delinquent a propertice, and ſnare for innocence. Its plaine, that the faction would have all, that adheared not to them, or left them delinquents, and if ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion be not minced, the law it ſelfe will be, whoſe Rules will not define delinquents, but the obſervation of them become delinquencie.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>a Traytour is the conſequent of his Treaſon, and a Rebell of his Rebellion.</hi> And ſuch are certainly delinquents, but for ſaking their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie is not a Cryme to denominate a delinquent, and ſuch only were by the faction called delinquents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The London Tumults was the Kings overworne Theame, and ſtuffing of all his diſcourſes.</hi> Which was not at all mentioned in this place, but tis a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95058:91"/>Theame of difficultie to the Libeller, and wherefore, he would ſtopp the beleife of it by his threed bare repetitions of the blood of the warr, delinquents, Tyrany, and Popery, which are become as vaine, as the taunts of children.</p>
               <p>He <hi>turnes to the Scotts, and Covenanters, whome he calls miſobſervers of the Covenant,</hi> and askes <hi>how they will reconcile the preſervation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. With the Kings reſolution, that eſteemes all the Zeale of their proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Covenant noe better then a noyſe, and ſhew of pietie, &amp;c.</hi> For the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters, and miſobſervers of the Covenant we leave to debate their owne controverſies, but noe man knowes what he ſuppoſes, that by thoſe principles <hi>the King might at length come to take the Covenant, and that then all had ended in a happy peace,</hi> which he hates vpon any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but his owne.</p>
               <p>He makes an oppoſition between <hi>the Kings telling God, that his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies are many, and telling the people they are but a faction of ſome few pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayling over his Major part of both houſes.</hi> Might not his Enemies be many, though a faction of a few prevailed over the Major part of both houſes, and wherein <hi>doth the King miſapply David, or David accuſe him?</hi> But the Libeller ſtickes not at miſapplication, nor falſe accuſations.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>he had noe paſſion, deſigne, or preparation to imbroyle his Kingdome in a Civil warr.</hi> The Libeller ſayes, <hi>true,</hi> &amp; yet formerly ſaid, that <hi>his fury incited him to proſecute them with the ſword of warr.</hi> How doth he handle his outworne Theame?</p>
               <p>But he gives a reaſon, for <hi>that the King thought his Kingdome to be Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachar, that would have couched downe betweene two burthens of Prelaticall ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and Civill Tyrany.</hi> As his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> ſubjects had peace without burthens, ſoe the reſt of Iſſachar was more eligible, then the blood, and Treacherie of Simeon, and Levi, whoſe rage, and crueltie their Father curſed vpon his death bedd, but ſuch attempts the libeller likes better then Iſſachars eaſe.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>the King had made preparation by terrour, and preventive force.</hi> The fury of a warr is come to terrour, and preventive force. Its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Rebells had vſed all meanes to prevent his defence, &amp; his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour muſt be litle, whoſe force they had ſurpriſed.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>God will finde out bloody, and deceitefull men, many of whome have not lived out halfe their dayes.</hi> The Libeller ſayes, <hi>It behoved him to have been more cautious, how he tempted God til his owne yeares had been further ſpent.</hi> Is it temptation to rely on the truth of Gods word? And may not innocent perſons, whoſe lives are ready to be taken away by blood thirſtie Tyrants reflect vpon Gods word touching wicked mens being cut of, though they ſee their owne life expiring?</p>
               <p>The King in his prayer ſayes, <hi>that God knew the cheife deſigne of this warr was either to deſtroy his reaſon, or force his judgment.</hi> The Libeller
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95058:92"/>ſayes <hi>This is hideous raſhnes accuſing God before men to know that for truth, which all men know to be falſe.</hi> And is it not horrid preſumption in the Libeller to ſay all men know that to be falſe, which himſelfe confeſſes true. And we muſt expect, that the wickednes of theſe Rebels, which accuſe veritie of vntruth will reproach the ſinceritie of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> in praying for his Enemies with hipocriſie, their owne corruption exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding confeſſion of others integritie.</p>

               <p>And firſt he ſayes <hi>noe King had ever more love at his firſt comming to the Crowne.</hi> Its true, but that moved envy in the ſeditious faction, who ſought to infuſe contrary inclinations into the people.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>never people were worſe requited firſt by his miſtruſt, that their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties were the impairing of his Regall power.</hi> He had ſoone cauſe to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, that the conſpiratours plotted to vndermine his Regall power, vpon pretence of the peoples rights, &amp; to that purpoſe rayſed jealoſies among them, the originall of all Rebellion.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95058:92"/>ſufficiently vindicate him from this aſperſion to hate thoſe, that were eſteemed Religious, but his pietie permitted him not to eſteeme hipocriticall ſectaries Religious, and his prudence inſtructed him, that theſe ſchiſmatickes, which this Libeller calls Religious maintained principles deſtructive to Government, which they then abiured, but now avow.</p>
               <p>That this was ſeene <hi>by his perſecuting,</hi> which was never ſeene, for <hi>the diſſolution of Parliaments</hi> he hath been already anſweared, but the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, which he hath added, whether more ridiculous, or abominable may not paſſe vnobſerved, which is, <hi>that theſe diſſolutions were after they had graunted more money, then would have bought the Turke out af Morea, and ſet free all the greekes.</hi> And yet the Parliament gave more to the Scotts for invading England. Doth this groſſe Mountebanque thinke, that the value of a ſubſidie in England, &amp; the number of them, that were graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the King are ſoe vnknowne, what owles, and buzzards doth he thinke would caſt their eyes on his papers? ſurely, if they be ſaleable, it is for ſport, or ſcorne, and he might aſwell have ſaid, it was enough to ſubvert the Turkiſh Empire.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>the King tooke Councell, how he might ſubdue them to his will.</hi> The reaſon of this pretence is to excuſe their Rebellious conſpiracie to ſubdue him to their will.</p>

               <p>His mention of <hi>exactions</hi> cannot be omitted, though falſe, &amp; imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. <hi>Diſarming of Trayned bands</hi> is not done by vſing ſome of their Armes in the publique ſervice, and it was farr from preparation to a Civill warr, to vſe Armes againſt a ſtranger, but what is this, that was done ſoe many yeares before?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The frained bands</hi> he ſayes <hi>were the moſt proper ſtrength of a free nation.</hi> And yet they are not permitted in ſome Republiques, though inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and improved by our Kings.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Ammunition was ingroſſed, and kept in the Tower</hi> was farr from the deſigne of a Civil warr on the kings part, it being a right of his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but a ſigne of their conſpiracie, and intention of Rebellion, that were troubled at the kings care for overſeeing the Ammunition of his Kingdome, and preventing the miſimployment either at home, or abroade.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:95058:93"/>
               <p>The <hi>not buying without licence,</hi> when noe man was denyed to buy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be interpreted a reſtraint, and the high rate could not imply any deſigne of warr, it might be of benifit. But were not all the places of England not only allowed, but commaunded to have their full ſtores for their trained bands, and had not all ſhipps their full proportions of Ammunition? Theſe are potgun preparations for a Civill warr.</p>
               <p>But ſayes the Libeller, <hi>theſe were his Councells, either to a Civil warr, if it ſhould happen, or to ſubdue without a warr, which is all one.</hi> Noe doubt its all one in the Authors Judgment, for he eſteemes the meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve obedience a ſufficient ground for Rebellion. But if the King provided againſt a Civill warr, if it ſhould happen, is that a reaſon in ſubjects to make it? And doe not they begin the hoſtilitie, by whome this warr happens, and if the Kings preparations were, if a Civill warr ſhould happen, muſt not this Civill warr happen by others, not him, who prepared only to prevent, and defend:</p>
               <p>Thus farr he hath left the firſt Act of hoſtilitie vpon his Maſters, and now he comes to the <hi>rayſing of two Armies againſt the Scotts,</hi> which were both diſbanded before this warr begun, and who was the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the word well knowes.</p>
               <p>But he ſayes <hi>the latter of them was raiſed to the moſt perfidious breaking of a ſolemne pacification.</hi> His rayling ſignifes his owne impietie, and want of matter that inſteede of declaring the fact of the firſt Engliſh hoſtilitie ſeekes for ſcandalls from a Scotch Treatie, and would make the King perfidious in his defence, becauſe they are Traytours in their aſſault.</p>
               <p>He comes now to the beginning of this Parliament, and talkes of bringing vp the Armies, and his often decanted <hi>Iriſh Papiſts, and french Army,</hi> that never ſtruke blow to be Councells for beginning a Civill warr, but theſe apparitions were vaniſht long before the warr begun. <hi>The letters to the King of Denmarke</hi> have been ſufficiently cleered from being Councells, or preparations to make a Civill warr, and the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler cannot fix any preparations vpon the king, but in caſe a warr ſhould be made vpon him, which was then plotted, and evident to all knowing men.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>theſe, and many other were his Councells towards a Civill warr.</hi> If the king ſhould have taken noe Conncell to have reſiſted the violence, not only prepared, but begun againſt him, it had been vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly, and vnnaturall, knowing how maliciouſly, and perfidiouſly the conſpiratours had called in the Scots, bribed them with vaſt ſumms of money racked from the people vpon pretence of the kings ſervice, how they had treacherouſly corrupted diverſe officers, and ſouldiers of the kings army, how they had diſperſed falſe reports of him, and his Actions to diſaffect the people, how they had given li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95058:93"/>to all lewde perſons to preach hereſie, and Treaſon in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, how they had endeavoured to weaken the bonds of Government by puniſhing men for obſerving the lawes, by commending, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardinge malefactours, how they had affronted the king, and ſtirred vp the rabble to threaten violence to him, if he refuſed their demaunds, and muſt he not now prepare for his defence, or ſubmit his judgment?</p>
               <p>His refuſing <hi>to diſband that Iriſh Army</hi> ſhewes noe intention of his to a Civill warr, but the Rebells earneſt ſollicitation for the diſbanding of that Army, and the Engliſh Army, likewiſe leaving the Scots vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſbanded ſhewes their falſe pretentions, and malicious preparations by diſarminge the king of all Armies to ſubdue him to their wil. Theſe Rebells, that ſeized the <hi>Tower</hi> to ſtrengthen themſelves for making a warr would have it beleived, that the Kings keeping it, which had all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been in his poſſeſſion, was a preparation to make a warr, and while they affronted him in his Court every day would have his guard preparations to make a warr.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe waggons of ammunition</hi> to be prepared by the King in that low condition, and want of all things for warr, which he then was in, are ſomewhat ſtrange, although neceſſary for him againſt the continued Acts of violence vſed by the Tumults, and avowed by the faction in Parliament, and their continuall preparations for a warr, and it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Libellers impudence, that would have ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible preparations in reſpect of the Rebells force by land, and ſea, and poſſeſſion of the forts, Navy, and Citie of London, and Magazins of the Kingdome, ſhould be for the making of a warr vpon them, which was in all reaſon ſoe vnable to withſtand them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The appearance of ſome hundreds of horſe at Kingſton,</hi> ſhewes how gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they are of pretences, that make ſuch a ſcare crow a cauſe of their Rebellion.</p>
               <p>And <hi>the Queenes buying of Armes, and the forces rayſed in yorke ſhire</hi> were much leſſe then needed, when the Rebells had aſſumed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the Kingdome vnder their owne Commaund. And <hi>their petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the King for peace</hi> (which the Libeller mentions to be that while) was that the King would ſubmit to their Government, and doe what they required, and with what face now could any ingenuous man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the cheife deſigne of the warr was either to deſtroy his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or force his judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to act of hoſtilitie, it is not much materiall, in whome it firſt begun after ſuch Councells, and preparations.</hi> It is materiall to the truth of the fact, whatever the Councells were, but he hath not named a Councell, or preparation for warr but ſucceeding the deſigne of Rebellion, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence begun, againſt their rage, all that he ſuppoſes on the Kings part, that looked towards a warr being only defenſive, and on the part of the Rebells plainely oppreſſive,</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:95058:94"/>
               <p>But he ſayes <hi>in the Act alſoe the King will be found to have had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedenice, if not at London by the aſſault of his armed Court vpon the naked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his attempt vpon the houſe of Commons, yet certainly at Hull, first by his cloſe practices on that Towne, next by his ſeidge.</hi> Was the Kings going with his guard to the houſe of Commons a proper army to make a warr, they heeretofore called it a breach of priviledge, and is it now growne ſoe big with time to be called a warr? And muſt that, which continued not an hower be defended with an Army rayſed many moneths after? And is his Iron flaile, and the Parliaments Clients, that were ſoe terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make lawes by force become a naked people, &amp; the ragged Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment a formidable Army? But if theſe doe not prove the King to have done the firſt act, for it ſeemes he doubted it would not, yet at Hull he is ſure, and if the King had fortified all, or any of the Townes of his Kingdome, is that the act of warr? Is not the law evident, that he may doe it, and hath it not been the approved practice of all ages? And if he beſeidged Hull, who began the warr, they that ſurprized it, or he that would recover it? And yet the Libeller gravely concludes from this fardle, that the King is truly charged with beginning the warr, though the particulars themſelves evince the contrary.</p>
               <p>He ſayes that <hi>at the Iſle of weight, he charged it vpon himſelfe at the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique Treatie.</hi> What he did at that Treatie is well knowne to be in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the procuring of peace, and though they, that treated with him would have an Act to acquitt them for their ſecuritie, yet that could not alter the fact, and the King tooke nothing on himſelfe by conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to paſſe an act, if the Treatie tooke effect, which act by law, to whoſe interpretation only it was ſubject, could not be expounded to charge the king with the beginning of that warr, but ſo mainfeſt is the vntruth of their pretence, that they would aide their cauſe by inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from an Act of their owne importunitie, and violence for their owne ſecuritie.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>the ſecuring of Hull was noe ſurpriſal, but a timely prevention.</hi> But was it not allwayes in the Kings power, and Cuſtodie before, and what they did to Hull, they did to his other Caſtles, and is it noe ſurprizall to diſpoſſeſſe thoſe, that are in poſſeſſion?</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>it were folly beyound ridiculous to count our ſelves a free nation, if the King againſt the Parliament might appropriate to himſelfe the ſtrength of a whole nation, as his proper goods.</hi> And is it leſſe ridiculous to count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a free nation, if the Parliament may appropriate to themſelves all the ſtrength of the kingdome, as their owne proper goods againſt al the people, are they more a free nation, becauſe they have many Maſters? Our nation juſtly accounted it ſelfe a free nation, and yet a king had all the ſtrength of the kingdome appropriated to him, as his owne proper goods, and they have ſeene how their libertie was preſerved by that conſtitution, &amp; how it hath been loſt by vſurpation of this right in the name of Parliament.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:95058:94"/>
               <p>The Parliament had never <hi>the life, and death of lawes in their power,</hi> and the people never thought it for their Securitie, that they ſhould, and the Libeller may with as good reaſon call ſucceeding acts preventions aſwell, as this taking of Hull <hi>a Securing.</hi> Are not the taking of Townes Acts of hoſtilitie vnder what name ſoever, had not the taking of Hull been an Act of hoſtilitie in an Enemy? And is it leſſe in a Rebell? The queſtion is now of an act of hoſtilitie, not the right of it, and that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king af a Towne is not an act of hoſtilitie wilbe incredible to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt capacitie, and noe leſſe, that the Parliament have a power of hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie againſt the king.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>the law of the land is at beſt but the reaſon of Parliament.</hi> And the reaſon of Parliament is noe reaſon if it differ from the opinion of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, witnes his cenſure of voting the kings conceſſions a ground for peace: &amp; it were as diſſonant from law, as reaſon, that a kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be ſubject to the reaſon of a Major part in Parliament.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes, <hi>they knew his cheifeſt Armes left him were thoſe only, which the ancient Chriſtians were wont to vſe againſt their perſecutors, prayers, and teares.</hi> At this the Libeller makes an exclamation, <hi>O Sacred reverence of God, reſpect, and ſhame of men, whither were ye fled, when theſe hipocriſies were vttered? Was the Kingdome at all that coſt of blood to remove prayers, and teares.</hi> Shakeſpeare could not have framed a fitter exclamation for Rich. 3. Doubtles reverence of God, reſpect, and ſhame of men are fled from this man, that makes this vaine, &amp; prophane outcry. Doth it follow, that becauſe the King got ſtrength, therefore he was poſſeſt of it, when they rebelled againſt him? doth not he reproach him, that all his adherents hardly amounted to the making, vp of one ragged Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtrong enough to aſſault the vnarmed houſe of Commons? And can he thinke there is a God, that cryes out ſacred reverence of God, vpon occaſion of theſe words of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> was ever king more deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of aide, and might more truly vſe that expreſſion then he. Thoſe <hi>thouſands of Cavileers,</hi> whoſe number he ſoe often deſpiſed, and now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances are a conviction of his contempt of God, and men, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes is more abominable, then any oaths, curſes, and carouſes he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. And <hi>the numbers muſtred on He worth Moore</hi> were a ſufficient proofe of the Kings want of Armes to make a warr, as they were then the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Rebells ſcorne, &amp; were not the Libeller as vaine, as wicked, he would not have mentioned the ſale of the <hi>Crowne Iewells,</hi> to buy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes for a ground of his exclamation, when nothing could ſhame him more, were he capable of it, for may not a man juſtly ſay, that the chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Armes left a King were prayers, &amp; teares, when all his viſible mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to procure Armes were the Jewells of his Crowne? &amp; thoſe guns, which were bought with the Jewells, he calls <hi>deadly inſtruments of warr,</hi> but the inſtruments of Rebells are harmeles and vnkilling. Men of corrupt conſciences thinke they may prophane the name of God at
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95058:95"/>their pleaſure by making their lewde conſtructions of words, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And although this libeller jeere at the Kings weakenes in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this warr, which was viſible to all the world, &amp; the ſtrength he found was vnexpected by his Enemies, and that all men judged pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, and teares his cheifeſt Armes, yet becauſe ſtrength came to him, the Libeller calls <hi>Ammunition, Regiments, and Brigades, prayers, and teares,</hi> his ordinary Armes being ſlander, vntruth, and prophanes.</p>
               <p>In his next words he ſayes, <hi>they, who fought for the Commonwealth have by the helpe of better prayers vanquiſhed.</hi> It ſeemes he holds not their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers their cheifeſt Armes, who truſted more in other Armes, then their prayers, and might thence have reaſonably concluded, that their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was not given to their prayers, but permitted for the ſins, &amp; ſcourge of the nation.</p>
               <p>The King <hi>reckons not the want of the Militia in reference to his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, as his peoples. Not conſideringe</hi> ſayes the Libeller, <hi>how ill for ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares he had protected them, and the miſeries are like a forked Arrow, it cannot be drawne out without inciſion of more fleſh.</hi> He hath told vs, that thoſe miſeries of ſeventeene yeares were peace, and plentie, which thoſe merciles Phiſitians will cure by an endles warr, letting out the blood, and tearing the fleſh of the afflicted people, and wee now deſcerne what Phiſike they intended for the Kingdome. Sawes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them, ſwords to lance them, and famine to pine them, till they were ſufficiently purged of their former proſperitie, and he neede not have vſed ſoe many ſhifts to deny the beginning of the warr, when he ſayes the cure of the Kingdome was to be made with inciſions. What want of protection appeared in thoſe ſeventeene yeares, never people were more ſecure? But the man miſtakes the ſcene of his exclamation, as his Sermonizers there notes, &amp; tell the people of ſuffring that knew none among them.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>the wings of faith may be miſtaken for the wings of preſumption,</hi> Preſumptuous men are miſtaken of the wings of faith, and this Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler hath ſufficiently expreſt himſelfe one of them, and may feare by his preſumption to fall head long.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes, <hi>that the Parliament have hung the <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> of King-ſhipp in an airy imagination of Regalitie betweene the priviledges of both houſes, like the tombe of Mahomett.</hi> To this ſayes the Libeller, <hi>he knew not that he was propheſying the death, and buriall of a turkiſh Tyrany, that ſpurned downe thoſe lawes, which gave it life, and being, ſoe ſtrong, as it endured to be a regulated Monarchy,</hi> he was not propheſying, but relating a plaine ſtory how a juſt Monarchy was oppreſt by a Turkiſh impoſture, and Tyrany, and and Empire ſett vp in an Army of Janizaries, that ſpurned downe al law, and Religion, and as the Turkiſh doctrine of propogating their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition by blood, and warr was preached vnto the people, as their dutie to doe the like for their new hereticall fancies, ſoe their
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95058:95"/>deceites in making the King a fantaſtique ſuppoſition, and his authoritie nothing els, but the opinions of the two houſes was as groſſe, and lewde, as the imaginary Miracle of Mahometts Tombe.</p>
               <p>From the Kings words touching the vſe of the Militia, <hi>that he would but defend himſelfe ſoe farr, as to defend his good ſubjects from theſe mens vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, who perſwade the world, that none but wolves are fitt to be truſted with the Custody of the ſheepeheard, and his flocke.</hi> The Libeller would inferr this a cleere confeſſion from his owne mouth, that <hi>if the Parliament had left him the ſole power of the Militia, he would have vſed it to the deſtruction of them, and their friends.</hi> And is an vſe for defence againſt wrong, and fraude, an vſe to deſtruction? And if the faction called Parliament be not permitted to deſtroy the ſheepeheard, and his flocke, is it a deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them? But they knew themſelves wolves, and could not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, while any power was out of their hands, &amp; therefore would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, that they were fitteſt to be truſted with that, which was the ſole defence againſt their rapacitie.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>the King hath been often told, that he had noe more power over the ſword, then the law.</hi> But who told him ſoe? Never any but knowne Rebells Parliaments have allwayes ſaid the contrary, and the practice of it in all times was never queſtioned. Though Kings cannot be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Judges, yet all Juſtice flowes from them, and by their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and becauſe their condition, and place requires, that Juſtice be adminiſtred by their deputies according to the Cuſtome of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, therefore they have not power to vſe the Militia, which is moſt proper to their place, and cannot be ſeperated from their perſon, could not be told by reaſonable men.</p>
               <p>The pretended feare of Rebells, that <hi>he may by this power controll the law</hi> they will not extend to their owne power of the militia, and may not their Rebell generall controll all lawes by the power of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? And doth he not? The ſubjects of England vnderſtood the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of their lawes to reſt in their King, whoſe intereſt they knew it was to preſerve them. Tyrany, and breach of lawes would make his Eſtate vnſecure, and dangerous, and therefore they fought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him againſt ſuch, as would deſtroy their lawes, and him. But in this clamour of the Libeller he only ſeekes to vilifie Monarchicall Government, and to perſwade all people, that live vnder Kings, that they are not free, and vnderſtand not what is libertie, as is in other formes of Government the people were not Commaunded, and might chuſe their owne lawes, and order their warrs. There is frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the Roman Commonwealth of the Rebellion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnder ptetence of libertie, and ſeditious inclinations will aſſoone take occaſion to object Tyrany to ſenates, &amp; Parliaments, as kings What ſtate can thoſe Rebells frame, that may not degenerate into a Tyrany,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95058:96"/>but they only ſeeke pretences for their Rebellion againſt the preſent Government to transferr it to themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King is contented to reſigne his power for his owne time.</hi> And ſayes the Libeller <hi>he is carefull, wee ſhould be ſlaves to his poſteritie, and leaue vs the legaice of another warr about it.</hi> There is noe doubt, but the Rebells deſired the Militia to enſlave the people, and deſtroy the king, and they would rather be devills then ſubjects. This Libeller makes noe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene a ſubject, and a ſlave, and though they pretended the ſetling of the Militia in reſpect of preſent danger, yet they are ſoe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent to reject the kings offer to ſettle it for his owne time.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>the King calls the Parliament a many headed Hydra of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not more eyes them mouths,</hi> which he falſely recites, for the King ſayes, <hi>As this many headed Hydra of Government makes a ſhew to the people to have more eyes to ſee, ſoe they will finde it to have more mouths too to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and heere the Libeller according to his cuſtome anſweares ſenſe with non ſenſe, for he ſayes, <hi>ſurely not more mouths, nor ſoe wide, as the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute rabble of his Courtiers both hees, and ſhees, if there were any males among them.</hi> Doth he make a queſtion, whether any males, and yet talke of a diſſolute rabble? And are the new ſenatours commaunded ſingle life to prevent the generation of Traytours? But the Kingdome findes, that thoſe numbers of leane kine have devoured more in ſeven yeares, then all the Courtiers in ſeven hundred.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>to diſpute what kinde of Government is beſt would prove a long Theame, it ſufficeth, that his reaſons heere for Monarchy are found weake, and inconſiderable.</hi> We have the word of a grave Author for it, who hath made long invectives, &amp; yet never handled the Theame, nor anſweared any one reaſon produced for Monarchy, &amp; though it be a long Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to diſpute what Government were beſt in his judgment, yet he might have made the queſtion ſhorter by diſputing, whether ſubjects might Rebell to ſubvert the Monarchy vnder which they live, And he would have Tyrany a ground for Rebellion, and that Tyrany to be Monarchy, and if the diſpute be long, the ſolution wilbe very eaſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King is not our ſun, though he would be taken for it.</hi> And why did he ſay, that the ſun in all figurative vſe, and ſignification beares alluſion to a King, &amp; blames the king for his compariſon of the Earle of Strafford, and heere reprehends the alluſion to himſelfe? but they wilbe the ſun, and ſet the would on fire.</p>
               <p>He aſkes <hi>wherefore we ſhould not hope to be governed more happily without a King, when all our miſerie hath been by a King, or by our neceſſary vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and defence againſt him.</hi> He may not well hope to be governed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily by thoſe, that have gotten power by wicked Arts. An vnjuſt power wil ſeeke to ſupport it ſelfe by the ſame meanes it was rayſed. It cannot be hoped, that they will governe happily, that ſeeke the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the greateſt part of the people, and that can ſecure their private
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95058:96"/>fortunes, what ever become of the Kingdome. They cannott hope for Gods bleſſing, which only can make happy vpon the many wilfull, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, hipocriſies, &amp; cruelties, which they vſed to vſurpe this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the perſecution, and murther of their lawfull ſoveraigne, and they, that prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded miſerie they knew not for a ground to change their Government, will finde it by their folly, and madnes.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>the King would be thought enforced to perjury by having graunted the Militia, by which his oath bound him to protect the people.</hi> The Libeller aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, <hi>if he can be perjured in graunting that, why doth he refuſe for no other cauſe the aboliſhing of Epiſcopacie?</hi> The Libeller himſelfe hath expreſt other cauſes of his refuſall to aboliſh Epiſcopacie, but why may not one be perjured in both, being equally bound by his oath. If the Libeller have a ſenſe in this, its very miſticall, vnles he meane, that a man neede not feare many perjuries, that committed one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The protection of Delinquents</hi> was no part of his oath, <hi>but of the innocent,</hi> and that he ought to doe againſt popular fury, and any vſurpt authoritie vnder what name ſoever.</p>
               <p>That he was <hi>to protect by ſuch hands, as the Parliament ſhould adviſe him,</hi> was noe part of his oath, and he could poorely protect, that muſt expect ſuch hands, as others ſhould allow him, that were an oath to as litle vſe, as the power it ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He may not hold a violent, and incommunicable ſword over vs vnder the ſhew of protection.</hi> And muſt there not be a ſword of protection, becauſe it may be turned to violence, this is Rebells Logicke, that would have no Judges, becauſe they may be corrupt? &amp; theſe, that terrifie the people with the dangers of violence vnder lawfull Governours vſe power moſt Tyranically, but wherefore <hi>incommunicable,</hi> he thinkes it a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering word to ſtartle the people like Arbitrary Government, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall lawes. Is the ſword of the ſupreame power communicable, if it be in many hands, what if they fight one with another, which is the ſword then to protect the people, and how will they fight for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties?</p>
               <p>The King ſayes, <hi>that his yeilding the Militia was from the love of publique peace, and aſſurance of Gods protection.</hi> The Libeller aſkes, <hi>wherefore this aſſurance of Gods protection came not till the Militia was wrung out of his hands.</hi> Whence can he conclude, that it came not till then? But the wringing of the Militia out of his hands ſhewes how impudently theſe men pretend right, or truth for their Actions, muſt a man give vp his ſtrength, when it is demaunded, becauſe he hath an aſſurance of Gods protection, and becauſe he ſees ſome reaſon to part with it, as the king did for love of publique peace, muſt he not therefore have an aſſurance of Gods protection? his holding it faſt was his dutie, and the wringing it from him hath open injuſtice both in the Act, and intention. And the Libellers prophanes in jeering at the kings ſaying, that <hi>God was able
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95058:97"/>abundantly to compenſate him, as he did to Iob whatever honour, power, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie Chaldeans, ſabeans, or the Devill himſelfe deprived him of</hi> ſaying <hi>Iob vſed noe Militia, nor Magazine at Hull.</hi> Is not vnlike the Apoſtates ſcoffing at the Chriſtians patience, and ſuffering.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes, <hi>Although they take all from him, yet can they not obſtruct his way to heaven.</hi> The libeller ſayes, <hi>tis noe handſome occaſion to tell vs whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was going.</hi> And hath it been an vnhandſome occaſion in the ſaints of God to take occaſion from their afflictions to declare their reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? But theſe are his common cenſures.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>private prayers in publique aſke ſomething of whome they aſke not.</hi> But prayers vpon a publique occaſion loſe not their reward for being publique.</p>

                  <hi>THE King vſes plauſibilitie of large, and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite words to defend himſelfe at ſuch diſtance, as may hinder the eye of Common Iudgment from all diſtinct view, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his reaſoning.</hi> It is the Libellers labour to keepe his reaſoning from Common view, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeekes to divert the readers by Chimericall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and invectives againſt Monarchy, and repeated common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of miſgovernment. Vpon examination the Kings plaine, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct reaſoning will appeare convincing to every right judgment.</p>
               <p>The Libeller ſayes. <hi>The king ſhewes not, how it can happen, that the peace of a people ſhould be inconſiſtent with the conſcience, and honour of a King.</hi> And doth this man hold, that the King ought to ſacrifiſe Religion, Juſtice, and pietie for the peace of his people? Shall he deſtroy inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent men, and perſecute Chriſtians to procure peace? Or are theſe things conſiſtent with honour, &amp; conſcience? and may not ſuch things be deſired by a wicked people in order to peace? And therefore the Libeller vainely preſſes, that <hi>nothing is more agreeable to the conſcience, and honour of a King, then to preſerve his ſubjects in peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:95058:97"/>
               <p>And is there any thing more contrary to the conſcience, &amp; dutie of ſubjects, then to procure a Civill warr, by demaunding conceſſions of their King, which in honour, and conſcience he cannot grannt, &amp; which being graunted would be noe ground for a laſting peace, though it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded a preſent warr.</p>
               <p>The Libeller aſkes <hi>which of the propoſitions were obtruded on him with the point of the ſword, till he with the point of the ſword thruſt from him both propoſitions, and propounders.</hi> A ſtrange queſtion in this Libeller, that hath ſoe often obtruded the feares, and terrours rayſed in the King by the Tumults, and Iron flaile, ſeizing of the Magazins, and not leaving him a ſword, that had a point to thruſt, but this Theame is too much ſoyled by ſoe often repetition, and yet he proceedes to talke of <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les obtruſions, which for almoſt twentie yeares the King had been forcing vpon tender conſciences by all ſorts of perſecutions.</hi> And theſe tender conſciences he will allow to be preferred before the peace of the Kingdome. Truly theſe are not large, and indefinite words, but apparent abſurdities to the eye of every Common judgment, that the pretended conſcience of every hipocriticall ſectarie muſt be preferred to the peace of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the King muſt be allowed none, but loſe life, and Kingdome, or proſtitute his conſcience. The Libellers examination of the Kings booke, it ſeemes was noe other, then of his owne writings, that huddles vp contradictions, and abſurdities ſoe obvious to the firſt ſight. His la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to declaime againſt <hi>perſecution</hi> is not matter of fact, and the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie of it hath been already ſufficiently detected.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes <hi>Many things are required of him, nothing offred in requitall.</hi> And the Libeller demaunds. <hi>What could ſatiate the deſires of this man, who being King of England, and Maſter of almoſt two millions yearely was ſtill in want.</hi> And yet the Maſters in the new ſtate affirme in their decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the conſtant Revenue of the Crowne exceeded not a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pound a yeare, And why ſhould not the King expect contributions from his ſubjects, aſwell as al his Predeceſſours ſtill had? And why will this man deny him ſupplies, that ſoe often obtrudes his wants, and he will have the King content with Rebells Charitie, and allowes them to take al from him, when they liſt, as the ſubjects money, this is the ſupreame honour, and Revenue, that the king ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelfe with.</p>

               <p>The Libeller proceedes to ſhew, that <hi>Monarchy cannot permit the requiſites neceſſary to ſocietie.</hi> That <hi>the will of one man in Government is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to freedome.</hi> And why not the will of five hundred to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the reſt, as much as that one?

If we looke vpon the moſt ancient ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the world, we finde the people both in peace, and warr com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by one man, nature teaching the neceſſitie of one generall in an Army, and the Government, which God himſelfe appointed to his people was by one man, and as moyſes was at firſt, ſoe were his ſucceſſours, and the kings after Saul, and David, and this Libeller can ſpeake nothing of this power of one man, but muſt cenſure, and vilifie Gods owne inſtitution, he offers nothing againſt Monarchy but what hes equall oppoſition to Parliament, and all formes of Government, for the peoples good, for which he ſayes the king hath his rights, will aſſoone become a pretence for Rebellion againſt any Rulers, as kings.</p>
               <p>His denyall, that <hi>the King is not greater then his Parliament,</hi> is only oppoſinge his bare word to all ſenſe, and reaſon, for doth the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter petition the leſſe, and yet the Parliament conſtantly petition the king.</p>
               <p>He ſayes <hi>the King can doe noe wrong.</hi> And have not they then, that pretend he had done wrong committed diſobedience, and wrong?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King can doe noe right but in his Courts.</hi> And if they be his Courts, and his deputies, and doe all in his name, doth it not follow, that it is his doing? And though the kings ſitt not ordinarily in their Courts, yet they have often ſate in ſeverall Courts, and in Parliament the King himſelfe gives orders, as appeares by the Preſidents of all times, and wherefore did the Parliament preferre their petition of right to the King, and importuned his anſweare, if he had noe power to doe right, but by his Courts? But what concernes the adminiſtration of Juſtice by deputies is not peculiar to England, but to all other Kingdomes.</p>

                  <hi>It is our ill hap, that three kingdomes ſhould be peſtred with one conſcience, which ſcrupled to graunt what the Parliament adviſed him.</hi> But it was the miſerie of the three kingdomes, that a faction of depraved men, that had caſt away conſcience ſhould overſway the Parliament, and demaund graunts for their owne ambition againſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It was the juſt judgment of God, that he, who was ſoe cruell, and remorſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to other mens conſciences, ſhould have a conſcience ſoe cruell to himſelfe.</hi>

               <p>The Libeller recites, that the King ſaid <hi>he thought fit to deny ſome things in honour, &amp; Policie, though he could approve them,</hi> which is not at al ſaid by the King, but that <hi>ſome things, which a King might approve, yet in honour, &amp; Policie might be denyed at ſome time to ſome men.</hi> And who doubts it, can there be a want of ſuch conſiderations in a King?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Good Princes thought it their happines to be allwayes graunting.</hi> How could that be, if it be true, which he ſayes they had nothing to graunt? But good ſubjects never demaunded that, which ſhould make their King vnable to graunt any more.</p>
               <p>He remembers himſelfe now, that <hi>good things were to be graunted for the things ſake, indifferent things for the peoples ſake,</hi> and he hath made it his continued Theame, that the King could graunt nothing in favour, but all was neceſſary in Juſtice, and it is apparent, that the kings large conceſſions invited theſe ingratefull Rebells to make thoſe ſhameles demaunds, which themſelves knew noe king in honour, Policie, and Juſtice could graunt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vndoubtedly his Coronation oath bindes him to a generall, and implicite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to whatever the Parliament deſired.</hi> And then vndoubtedly the king muſt be in worſe condition then any ſubject, for noe man but he is bound to ſuch a blinde obedience, and it is a ſtrange blindenes in this man to offer ſuch a thing to be beleived, which himſelfe holds incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for he ſayes, <hi>the Kings oath cannot binde him againſt neceſſary reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And can it then binde him to make wicked lawes, which muſt be reformed? Is the Parliament infallible, &amp; may they not make ill lawes? What is the reaſon, that the Libeller, and his Sectaries would not give obedience to Acts of Parliament vpon pretence of conſcience, &amp; ought the king to conſent to ſuch lawes, as the ſubjects ought not to obey?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King ought not to vie wiſedome with the Parliament,</hi> and why then doe the Libeller, and his Sectaries vie wiſedome with all former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Any of the Parliament may as farr excell him in the guift of wiſedome, as he them in place, and dignitie.</hi> But its very vnlike, and neere to impoſſible, eſpecially, if we looke to the experience of all times, and it is often found, that a King is wiſer, then all his Councell; And though the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller ſay <hi>ſure it was not he,</hi> meaning the King: as wiſe men, as any of his Councell, or Parliament thought it was he, &amp; never good ſubjects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with their King for that compariſon.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes, <hi>that that were, as if Sampſon ſhould have conſented to put out his eyes, that the Philiſtins might with more ſafetie mocke, and abuſe him.</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:95058:100"/>And this ſayes the Libeller <hi>out of an vnwiſe, or pretended feare of ſcorne for yeilding to his Parliament, he gives cauſe of ſuſpition, that he made a ſcorne of his Regall oath.</hi> Could any man ſuſpect, that his Regall oath bound him to ſuch a diſpicable ſlavery, that a king ſhould be in greater bondage to his Parliament, then any vaſſall to a Lord, a king might juſtly ſcorne ſuch an oath, that would make him ſcorned by all, when he had taken it, but the Libeller had noe better anſweare, and therefore retreates to his Common refuge of inſignificant repetition.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes <hi>to exclude him-from all power of denyall ſeemes an arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,</hi> The Libeller adds <hi>in the Parliament he meanes,</hi> and askes, <hi>what in him then to deny againſt the Parliament.</hi> It is no arrogance to deny in him, that is aſked, but arrogance in him, that aſkes, to receive noe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes <hi>its leaſt of all becomminge thoſe, that make their addreſſes in a humble, and loyall way of petitioning, who by that confeſſe their inferioritie, which oblidgeth them to reſt, if not ſatisfied, yet quieted with ſuch an anſweare, as the will, and reaſon of the ſuperiour thinkes fitt to give.</hi> To this the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſayes, <hi>petitioning in better Engliſh is noe more then requesting, or requiring.</hi> And is it not good Engliſh to call our prayers pititions, and is it better Engliſh to ſay wee require, when we pray, and is requeſting, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame in good Engliſh? Is the petitioning of his new Maſters requeſting or requiring?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Men require not favours only, but their due, and that not only from ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, but equalls, and inferiours.</hi> Its the firſt time, that ſuch requiring of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours was heard of, and a ſorry inference, that becauſe men require of equalls, they may of ſuperiours, and that there is noe difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſuperioritie of Government, and ſuperioritie in fortune, or Title.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was called, petitio conſulatus, when the nobleſt Romans went about, and begged that dignitie of the meaneſt plebeians naming them man by man.</hi> But might not thoſe, to whome they went, deny their petition? Could they require their election, as due, and was their begging, requiring? He would willingly make badd Engliſh out of good Lattyn, though good Lattin may be noe good manners from a ſubject to his king, and it is abſurd in Government for any to pray, that ought to commaund? &amp; the Libeller ſeemes diſtracted that would have petitioning requiring, and prove it by the ſignification it hath of begging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They petitioned not, becauſe all of them were inferiour, but becauſe he was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to any of them.</hi> But why then doe they petition in their politique Capacitie as a Parliament? He tells vs at laſt, <hi>it was for faſhions ſake more then dutie.</hi> But why then did they profeſſe it to be their dutie? He tells vs the Miſteries of their Religion, their profeſſions, and promiſes are Ceremonies, their ſubmiſſions for faſhion, this is the doctrine of cut throates.</p>

                  <hi>By plaine law cited before, the Parliament is his ſuperiour.</hi> And why had he not brought in petitio principy, as well as petitio conſulatus vſing it ſoe often, and that in good Engliſh is begging the queſtion. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he thinkes, that ſome beleive it is plaine law, becauſe he ſaith ſoe, but ſuch, as reade his booke finde he vnderſtands not law, nor reaſon, and will not ſpeake the truth, he vnderſtands</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It were a mad law, that would ſubject reaſon to ſupcrioritie of place.</hi> And doth not himſelfe ſay it, that the Parliament is ſuperiour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the kings reaſon muſt be ſubject to it? and is not he mad, or ſenſeles?</p>
               <p>He returnes againe to his invective againſt <hi>Monarchy, and one mans will,</hi> and ſoe its only the kings Cryme, that he was a Monarch, and if the King be not bound in a blinde obedience to all, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requires, we muſt all be ſlaves, a proper inference, and vpon this he concludes, that <hi>petitioning was but forme,</hi> becauſe he doth not like the Kingly Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be ſoe abſurd to binde the King to a blinde obedience as to confine the Parliaments reaſon to the will of one man.</hi> Much more abſurd to bind the King, and leave ſubjects vnconfined.</p>
               <p>That <hi>the King did nothing, but what was oppoſite to his profeſſed interest,</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed, but in his conceſſions to the late Parliament, and we finde by ſad experience, that nothing is more ruinous to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then a power in the Parliament over the King, and they have been ſoe farr from a power <hi>to confine the exorbitancie of Kings,</hi> that thoſe illegall conventions, which acted the Tragedies of ſome Kings were but the ſtales to vſurpers, and moulded to their will.</p>
               <p>That the King called them <hi>young ſtatesmen</hi> he imputes to <hi>arrogance.</hi> Doubtles the King might have ſaid much more, then what he did, that moſt part of theſe propounders were young ſtateſmen, Is there a man in England, that doubts it, if he regard either age, or experience, how they have governed themſelves, and the Kingdome all men ſee, who from ſoe greate tranquilitie have turned it into a lamentable combuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſpiſed the Kingdomes intereſt both at home, and abroade, that <hi>Phaetons miſcarriage</hi> was never ſoe anſweared by the practice of any raſh, and precipitate medlers in affaires of ſtate, as theſe vſurpers, and as they drove furiouſly with <hi>Iehu,</hi> ſoe they practized his hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, that loved the Kingdome better then the commaunds of God, and departed not from the ſins of Jeroboam, though he pretended Zeale for the Lord, and that <hi>omen</hi> of confuſion from ſuch fury, and madnes, his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> prayed God to divert, but the Libeller is pleaſed with his owne prognoſtickes, and makes augury a warrant for any vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, though the wickednes of his Maſters may give juſt occaſion to thinke, their vengeance fleepes not.</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:95058:101"/>
               <p>He comes now to dictate law, and tumbling of his repetitions, that <hi>the Parliament ſit not, as ſubjects, but ſuperiours, called not by him, but by the law.</hi> And doth not this man know the Parliament ſayes all this is falſe, and that they are his ſubjects, and called by his writ. Surely this Libeller takes pleaſure in outfacing all truth, otherwiſe he would not vſe ſuch abſurd, and palpable falſities, and that after himſelfe had ſaid the king was truſted with the ſummoning, and diſſolving of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</p>
               <p>Vnreaſonable deſires might be vnexpected by the king, and denyed. Wee may ſee, that <hi>Iehues fury, and Phaetons raſhnes</hi> were not ill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to theſe men, that held <hi>the enforcing of old lawes, repairing of injuries, moderate deſires of reformation,</hi> ſoe contemptible, that nothing, but the rooting vp of the foundation of Government could be a remedie for the kingdome, whoſe greate proſperitie was their greateſt greivance, and all thoſe good lawes, which he commends were vſeles, and to noe purpoſe.</p>
               <p>That they, which came to the Parliament had no authoritie to <hi>redreſſe greivances, but to deſire the redreſſe,</hi> was acknowledged a truth by the late Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, befor their inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was confirmed by the kings conceſſions.</p>
               <p>That <hi>their Fathers made as vaſt alterations to free themſelves from ancient Popery</hi> is much miſtaken, for whoever lookes into the reformation of Religion in England ſhall finde, that it moved from the head, and that the Parliament conformed themſelves vnto the Counſells taken by the king, and made not the alterations the Libeller ſuppoſes. Alterations were made, where corruptions had entred into doctrine, or practice, but it was very farr from eſteeming the primitive Church, a time of ſuperſtition, and plucking vp by the rootes, what ever was planted in the firſt ages of the Church. Sectaries are not to be judges of what varies from Scripture, their opinions ariſing from diſobedience, muſt needes be full of errour, and ſchiſme, and his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> had good reaſon to preferre the doctrine, and practice of the primitive Church before any moderne opinion of reformation, and as all the pregnant, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid reaſons of the Churches beyound the ſeas wrought leſſe with the faction in Parliament, then the Tumults, and rabbles, ſoe farr leſſe with this Libeller, that defends a ſchiſime from them all vnder the divided Conventicles of Independancy, and a crew of ignorant, and irreligious Hobgoblins that eate the fat of robbery, and oppreſſion. And he heere pretends the example of all the reformed Churches againſt Epiſcopacie, and afterwards confeſſes the Lutherans, who are the greater part of a contrary practice.</p>
               <p>The falſhood, &amp; giddines of their oracles are more ridiculous, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were <hi>the ſuperſtitious pilgramages of blinde votaries.</hi> he, that thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the kings oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the change of Church Government, while he ſtrives for innovation exclaimes againſt it, as a Cryme, for he ſayes
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95058:102"/>they would <hi>vindicate the Government of the Church, innovated, &amp; corrupted,</hi> he ſhould have ſhewed from what time it was corrupted.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes, <hi>ſuch, as were looked vpon before as factious in the ſtate, &amp; Schiſmaticall in the Church demaunded not only tollerations for themſelves in their vanitie, noveltie, and confuſion, but alſoe an extirpation of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe rights they had a minde to invade.</hi> And the Libeller askes, <hi>was this man ever likely to be adviſed, who ſetts himſelfe againſt his choſen Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and cenſures the Government of other proteſtant Churches as bad, as any Papiſt.</hi> Certainly ſuch Councellours were very vnfitt to adviſe, that were ſoe ill qualified, ſuch as the lawe judges offenders are incapable to judge of law, &amp; that ſuch were theſe demaunders is evident to al men, that know the lawes, and Government of England. There are noe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, that thinke their Government cenſured, if others dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from it, in any particular, but they will hold it a Schiſmaticall inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in any to endeavour to alter a Government well ſetled vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to introduce another againſt the will of the king. It imports not any contempt of the kingdome, if ſuch, as they choſe be found either defective, or falſe, and to engage the kingdome in all the impieties, that men act, which are choſe by them is as abſurd, as vainely pretended by the Libeller who will make a faction prevalent by Tumults, and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the kingdome, and the king ſhould have had his kingdome in greate contempt, if he had taken ſuch a faction for the kingdome.</p>
               <p>He drawes an Argument <hi>from the penaltie of being a Chriſtian vnder the heathens, and a Proteſtant vnder Papiſts.</hi> And ſurely had they ſought to introduce their Religion with the deſtruction of the Civill ſtate, ſuch a fact would have merited the name of treaſon, but their courſe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe Sectaries, who ſought only to enjoy the libertie of their conſcience, not to enforce others.</p>
               <p>That <hi>our ſaviour comming to reforme his Church was accuſed of an intent to invade Caeſars right, as good a right, as ever the Prelate Biſhopps had, the one being gotten by force, the other by ſpirituall vſurpation.</hi> Helpes not the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for our ſaviour was innocent of that falſe accuſation, declaring his kingdome not to be of this world, &amp; acknowledged Caeſars right, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the people to give vnto Ceſar the things, that were Ceſars, but this mans prophanes would have the accuſation true, and lawfull to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade Ceſars right from the falſe accuſation of our ſaviours, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly avowes invading of the Biſhopps rights, becauſe one better then ceſars, for to what other purpoſe doth he compare the rights of Ceſar, and the Biſhopps, vnleſſe to juſtifie their dealinge with the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopps.

               <p>The objection or <hi>to his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> repeating the arguments from law, antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Anceſtours, proſperitie, and the like</hi> was very improper from him, whoſe repititions of Tyrany, ſlavery, ſingle voyce, conſent of the kingdome, and ſuch like have blotted ſoe greate a part of his booke, and he, that would binde the king to follow the Example of other Churches will exclude antiquitie, and the primitive Church, and authoriſe the ſchiſme of innovating Sectaries, becauſe Papiſts have vſed Arguments againſt them.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes, <hi>had he two houſes ſued out their livery from the wardſhip of Tumults, he could ſooner have beleived them.</hi> But ſayes the Libeller <hi>it concerned them firſt to ſue out their livery from his encroaching Prerogative,</hi> The law allowes noe livery from Royall Prerogative, but judges them Rebells that ſeeke it.</p>
               <p>The Character ſett on them, <hi>that hunt after faction with their hounds the Tumults,</hi> the Libeller hath juſtified by his defence.</p>
               <p>Its noe ſhame for a King to be <hi>a pupill to the Biſhopps,</hi> whoſe calling it is to give him ſpirituall Councell, but it were madnes to be a laquay to ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who take vpon them to judge of the callings in the Church of God, which have noe calling to it, much more to a rabble, whome the Libeller himſelfe holds extravagant.</p>

Parliaments can be noe Mothers to kings, that are created by kings. The king is by the law of England Father of the Countrey, &amp; the life, and ſoule of the law, but the Libeller will finde out a ſtep Mother an Athalia to deſtroy the ſeede Royall, and ſett her meeſtuous broode vpon the throne, for theſe dreames were the deluſions of ſome prime Rebells, and could not allude vnto juſt Title, but conceites are growne low, when ſuch dreames muſt be fetcht in for reaſons.</p>

               <p>The King ſayes, <hi>theſe propoſitions are not the joint, and free deſires of both houſes, next that the choiſe of many members was carried by faction.</hi> He ſayes <hi>Charles the fifth againſt the Proteſtants in Germany laid the fault vpon ſome few.</hi> And what is that to the faction in England? If they be not the joint deſires of both houſes, as it was not, ought the King to take it for the advice of Parliament, and forbeare to ſhew the fraude, becauſe Charles the fifth ſaid the like vpon another occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Court was wont to tamper with Elections, and</hi> he ſayes <hi>noe faction was then more potent.</hi> And yet he affirmes they prevayled not, where then was their potencie?</p>
               <p>Becauſe the king ſayes, <hi>he cannot ſwallow ſuch Camells of ſacriledge, and Injuſtice, as others doe,</hi> The Libeller ſayes, <hi>he is the Phariſee, up, and downe, is not as other men are.</hi> Is it Phariſaiſme to profeſſe with the Prophett David the diſlike of them, that follow ſuperſtitious vainties. Becauſe the Phariſee ſwallowed Camells, be ſuch men Phariſees, that profeſſe they will not? &amp; becauſe the Sectaries pretended conſcience of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies like the Phariſees waſhing, the outſide, while they devoure the Eſtates of other men without remorſe, are they not Phariſees? and are they only, that profeſſe they cannot ſwallow ſuch Camells Phariſees? this is a new found Phariſee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The three Realmes all moſt periſhed for want of Parliaments.</hi> Wee have ſeene how neere periſhing they are by a Parliament, which hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted more Injuſtice ſince it began, then all our ſtories have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred for five hundred yeares before.</p>
               <p>The Libeller hath found out a new kinde of ſacriledge, for he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures not to have Church robbing called ſacriledge, and that is <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave a Chriſtian conſcience of libertie for the narrownes of his owne conſcience.</hi> And by what Engine is this ſacriledge committed, doth he, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaines for conſcience ſake bereave another mans conſcienc of libertie?</p>

Lieutenant, to gratifie them, &amp; then leaving the Kingdome without a ſucceſſour, and preparing the way to a Civill warr in England, ſtirring vp jealoſies againſt the King, and weakning his Authoritie, and compoſing Apologies for Rebellion, which would ſerve the Iriſ he pretences, aſwell as the diferences in England their deſignes, and thoſe Italian heads ſaw as much advantage from our broyles, as want of aide from <hi>other nations, who were buſied to the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95058:104"/>vtmoſt in their owne moſt neceſſary concernements;</hi> And therefore the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler vainely inferrs authoritie <hi>for aſſiſtance promiſed from England,</hi> vnles it were from the faction in the houſes, there being noe viſible ſtrength then in any other, &amp; there neede not, nor could be any private aſſurance vnto the Iriſh Rebells from any other, but that faction, and it is moſt apparent, that they neglected all meanes to remedie that miſcheife, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying themſelves wholy in laying the ground worke of the Rebellion in England, which they held their moſt neceſſary concernment, &amp; this was ground enough for Italian heads to ſtirr vp that Rebellion.</p>
               <p>The libeller proceedes vpon his ſuppoſitions, as if they were graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted truths, &amp; he would inſinnate <hi>an equivocation</hi> in what the King ſayes, <hi>That the ſea of blood is enough to drowne any man ineternall both infamy, and miſerie, whome God ſhall finde the malitious Author, or inſtigatour of that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</hi> Becauſe he ſayes <hi>the Rebells themſelves wil not confeſſe, that any blood was ſhed by them maliciouſly, but for the Catholique cauſe, or Common libertie.</hi> Therein they differ not from the Libeller, and his Engliſh Rebells, for they wil not confeſſe any of the blood they ſhed to be maliciouſly, but for Religion, and Common libertie, and thence the Libeller lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes his ſkill to caſt ſuſpitions vpon the plaineſt expreſſions of others, he well deſcerned, that the King vſed the word malicious for aggravation, not reſtriction, &amp; his obſervation was captious, when he read in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Period, that the King affirmes, <hi>nothing could be more abhorred of him being ſoe full of ſin againſt God, diſloyaltie to himſelfe, and deſtructive to his ſubjects,</hi> and calls God to wittnes, <hi>that as he could with truth waſh his hands in innocencie, as to any guilt in that Rebellion, ſoe he might waſh them in his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, as to the ſadd apprehenſion he had to ſee it ſpredd ſo far, &amp; make ſuch waſte.</hi> And the Libeller himſelfe after ſoe impertinent, and malitious an inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation confeſſes he denies, it both heere, and elswhere.</p>
               <p>But he ſayes <hi>there is in it no ſuch wide diſagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the ſcope of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Counſells,</hi> we are ſure there could not be agreement with the ſcope of his former Counſells. It was agreeable to the Counſells of Rebells to defame the King with this aſperſion, &amp; it is not ſtrange, that vntruths may be affirmed <hi>in three Kingdomes</hi> in reguard of the contrivers, that ſoe induſtriouſly ſpred them. But let vs heare his reaſons or reports. <hi>Its moſt certaine, that the King was ever friendly to the Iriſh Papiſts.</hi> And its certaine, that what he ſayes is falfe, but whats that to their Rebellion againſt himſelfe, or deſtroying his Kingdome?</p>
               <p>But his certaintie is, that the King <hi>in his third yeare againſt the plaine advice of Parliament, like a kinde of Pope ſold them many indulgences for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi> And was he a kinde of Pope to take their penalties of them, which the law enacted for their recuſancy, was that Pope like? That the King might not receive the penalties, which the law gave him, or take compoſitions, where the whole could not be had was never againſt the advice of Parliament, but this is a very long ſtride from his third
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95058:104"/>yeare to the beginning of the Rebellion, but how does he hang this togeather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The advancing the Popiſh partie</hi> he ſayes, but inſtances in noe particular, nor for <hi>negotiating vnderhand by Prieſts,</hi> which were as impertinent to an inference of the Kings friend-ſhip, or cauſing the Rebellion, as the vſe of ſuch perſons by Miniſters of State, though of different Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He engaged the Iriſh Papiſts in a warr againſt the Scotch proteſtants,</hi> there was never popiſh engagement againſt the Scotts for the King, if in the kings Army rayſed in that kingdome, there were Papiſts, it was without the engagement of their partie, but their engagement by alleagiance to their King, and whence doth it follow, that becauſe the King rayſed an Army in Ireland he muſt therefore rayſe the Rebellion in Ireland? and as its well knowne, that the keeping vp of that Army would probably have prevented the Rebellion of Ireland, &amp; that it was diſbanded long before that Rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brake foorth; ſo they, which complained ſo much of that Army, and importuned to have it disbanded, thereby prepared the way to their owne Rebellion as groundleſſe, and cruell, as that of the Iriſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſummer before that diſmall October a Committee of active Papiſts, all ſince in the head of the Rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> (yet Sr. Hardreſſe waller was one of them) <hi>were in greate favour at whitehall, and admitted to private conſultations of the King, and Queene.</hi> Then all Companies of Traytours are Committees from the example of the late Parliament. But he was loath to ſay, they were a Committee (as they were) from the lower houſe of Parliament in Ireland, which kept correſpondence with the faction of the Engliſh Parliament, and made addreſſes to them, and were encouraged by them in their proceedings with the King, and their comming over was who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſerve the deſigne of the faction in England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But noe meane matters were the ſubject of theſe conferences, for he gave away his peculiar right to more then five Iriſh Counties for an inconſiderable Rent.</hi> But it was not his right of ſoveraigntie, neither was this, which he calls noe meane matter a conference about the Rebellion, and this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar right, which this Libeller accuſes the King for parting with not to Papiſts peculiarly, but ſubjects in generall, the accuſers of the Earle of Strafford charged him for aſſerting to the King, and that inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Rent was in their judgment exceſſive, theſe are the colours of Juſtice, and truth, which theſe Rebells put on their Calumnies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They departed not till within two moneths before the Rebellion.</hi> Rebells or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly diſgiuſe their intentions, and therefore ſuch might frequent the Court, as the faction in Parliament pretended affection, and dutie, while they plotted to deſtroy the King, and now the Libeller reſorts to his Scotch Author, who he ſayes declares. <hi>What ſhould move the King to thoſe cloſe meetings,</hi> he, that beleives Sanders, Carries, and other Papiſts
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95058:105"/>in their virulent forgeries againſt Queene Elizabeth, may likely give credit to the Libeller, and his friend the Scotchman, and take vp infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Libells for true ſtories.</p>
               <p>The Libeller flies from hence to one of his common haunts, <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of bringing vp the Engliſh, and Scotch Army,</hi> and thinkes it noe repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, which he had ſoe often obtruded, and he inferrs, that becauſe <hi>the King could not prevayle with them,</hi> he <hi>betakes himſelfe to the Iriſh, who had in readines an Army of eight thouſand Papiſts, and a Committee heere of the ſame Religion.</hi> But what to doe to kill one another? If the King ſought to make vſe of the Iriſh, that rebelled, he might more advantagiouſly have done it, then by cutting one anothers throates, and had they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him aſſiſtance, they would not have conſumed themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſubjects there, and how could he tranſport that Army from Ireland, that was diſbanded before ever the Rebellion brake foorth, and the Committee departed two moneths before.</p>
               <p>He tells vs from his friend the Scotchman, that <hi>there were they, who thought now was the time to doe ſervice for the Church of Rome againſt the Puritant Parliament.</hi> Its very likely there were they, who thought the Puritan faction in Parliament had done more to the advantage of the Church of Rome by the embroyling of England, then ever had been done ſince the reformation, and they might well thinke it a fit time to attempt any deſigne againſt the Kingdome. And did not the Libeller thinke, that there are among the vulgar ſuch capacities, as receive le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends, and Romanſes for true ſtories, he would not ſoe groſſely produce ſuch diſcourſes of <hi>five Counties</hi> given to the Iriſh, and <hi>fower offred to the Scotch,</hi> And of like ſtuffe is his mention of the Kings attempt to <hi>pervert the Scotch Army from their way homeward, and the plot,</hi> which he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his Scotch Colleague <hi>to remove out of the way ſuch, as were moſt likely to withſtand, or not further his defignes.</hi> With this libertie of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doe theis Traytours ſeeke to maſke their villany</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a Commiſſion vnder the greate ſeale of Scotland commaunded this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi> Was taken vp after the pretence of the greate ſeale of England was detected of falſitie, and as this greate ſeale of Scotland hath aſmuch vntruth, ſoe it hath noe more colour, there being noe poſſibilitie for the King to vſe that ſeale, not at all in his power to ſuch a Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſending of the Ld. Dillon</hi> is of the ſame ſtampe, what the Iriſh did is eaſily graunted, but the falſhoods of this Libeller, and his friend the ſcotchman are no miſteries of iniquitie, but open, and detected cheates. &amp; one quotes the authoritie of the other, as if they were ſtrangers mett by chance, and make Libelling their worke to diſtract the people, and yet from theſe devices the Libeller will conclude, that <hi>the King cannot be doubted to be Author, or inſtigatour of that Rebellion.</hi> It had been ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to cite a gazett, but a branded ſtigmaticke, infamous. If his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be moved by ſuch Arguments, tis the leſſe wonder, that his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95058:105"/>and practice is ſoe corrupt, and he may reckon himſelfe among that rabble of the vulgar, he ſoe much deſpiſes.</p>
               <p>Theſe Teſtimonies likelyhoods, evidences, and apparent Actions, which he mentions in the declaration of July 1643. Are of as litle cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, as his friend the Scotchman. And there is not a more evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of malefactours, then their declarations againſt the king are of the guilt of thoſe, that contrived them, ſetting foorth their dutie, which the diſſembled, and condemning their actions, which they diſavowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not credible, that the Iriſh Rebells would be ſoe farr from humanitie, as to ſlander him being ſoe well received by him at Oxford.</hi> If a man had wanted an proofe of the Libellers abſurditie, he might heere be furniſhed by himſelfe, that drawes an Argument from the humanitie of the Iriſh, whoſe barbaritie, and Treacherie is ſoe greate a part of his accuſation againſt the king. They who were received at Oxford vpon offer of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, were very farr from pretence of ſuch a Commiſſion, and it may be aſwell concluded they had a Commiſſion at Oxford, as before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were there, and aſwell concluded, that they never Rebelled, as that they made noe ſalfe pretences of their Rebellion.</p>
               <p>The king neede not bring proofes againſt a groundles accuſation, that containes not any evidence of fact, and a ſingle denyall by al lawes is preferred before ſuch a charge, and it is as likely, that the Rebells in Ireland ſhould pretend his Seale, as thoſe in England his authoritie, &amp; noe man doubts of the invaliditie of a Rebells pretence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Chapter is not without witnes of his good affection to the Rebells,</hi> which he collects from that the king ſayes, <hi>they were leſſe in fault, then the Scotts, from whome they might alledge to have fetched their imitation, making no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> ſayes the Libeller, <hi>betweene men, that roſe neceſſarily to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which noe Proteſtant Doctrine ever diſallowed againſt them, who threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned warr, and thoſe who began a voluntary, &amp; cauſeles Rebellion.</hi> If the Iriſh made warr not to be reſtrained from their Religion, had they not the ſame cauſe, &amp; the ſame pretence of defending themſelves, as the other pretended for refuſing the Common prayer booke, and expelling Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopps? Where lies the odds? Is it Proteſtant Doctrine, that they may defend themſelves, and Papiſts may not, and that Proteſtants may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell for Religion, Papiſts may not? That were very much to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Religion, but the Libeller will not acknowledge the proteſtants, nor their Doctrine, who maintaine it to be vnlawful for ſubjects to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt the ſupreame power, though Tyranically abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and there is noe neede to fly to the Parliaments authoritie, if ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may take Armes againſt their king vpon pretence of defending themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Libeller well knowes the juſt indignation the Proteſtants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade have expreſſed for this ſcandall, the king names not the Scotts, but thinkes, that their blame muſt needes be greater, whoſe Actions
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95058:106"/>the Iriſh had to alledge for their imitation, <hi>by how much proteſtant prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are more againſt Rebellion, then thoſe of Papiſts</hi> ſuch, as inferre good affection to the Iriſh from ſuch premiſes will eaſily make vaine, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious rumours ſtrong proofes.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes, <hi>he hath the greateſt ſhare of diſhonour, and loſſe, by what is committed.</hi> The Libeller, as before makes this noe Argument, becauſe <hi>every one, that offends God, or his neighbour hath the greateſt ſhare of loſſe and diſhonour in the end,</hi> and have they not worldly ends, in offending God, and if theſe ends were not ſought by them, they would not offend God?</p>
               <p>He pretended before, that <hi>this was a politique contrivance of the King,</hi> and now he would have it <hi>an act without deſigne.</hi> Doth he thinke, that the malitious reports of him, and his Scotchman are of weight to make a man ſuſpected of an act directly tending to his owne vndoing, and would the King inſtigate the Iriſh Rebellion for his owne ends to have the aſſiſtance of the Iriſh, which by ſuch engagement could not aſſiſt him. Though preſumptions are noe convincing proofes, yet they are more credible, then ſuſpitions, or reports. It is a ſtrong Argument for the peoples confidence in their King more then in other men, becauſe his intereſt lies cheifely in the common welfare of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and it is hard to beleive, that a King will knowingly doe any thing againſt that intereſt, and to his owne loſſe, and diſhonour, and whenever any have offended in that kinde, the proofe of it hath been more apparent, then the authoritie of rumours, and Libells, but heere the act it ſelfe cannot have any poſſibilitie of concurrence to the Kings ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It too notoriouſly appeares in another ſection,</hi> which he Mangles, but ſhall heere have it whole. The King ſayes, <hi>tis thought by many wiſe men, that the prepoſterous rigour, and vnreaſonable ſeveritie, which ſome men car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed before them in England was not the leaſt incentive, that kindled, and blew vp into thoſe horrid flames the ſparkes of diſcontent, which wanted not prediſpoſed fewell for Rebellion in Ireland.</hi> The Libeller ſayes that <hi>theſe ſome men are the Parliament. And if the Rebells had feed an Advocate, he could hardly have dazled better.</hi> Truly the Libellers too notoriouſly doth not amount to a dazling of any eyes from deſcerning his vaine confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Does any thing heerein excuſe a Rebellion, that ſpeakes only of what ſucceded it? And if the kings cenſure of the proceedings of ſuch, as managed the buſines againſt the Rebells, ſhew an affection to the Rebells then certainely moſt Princes, that have had warrs in Ireland were very guiltie of that affection, that vſed like cenſures, but what the king ſayes heere was ſpoken in Parliament by diverſe members, who diſadviſed the prepoſterous ſeveritie, that was propounded, and afterward proceeded in, and it will reſt an indelible blemiſh of a raſh, and vnadviſed Councell in thoſe men, that in the beginning of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95058:106"/>would put a whole nation into deſpaire, and feare of extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
               <p>That <hi>their wonted oppreſſions,</hi> as they conceived <hi>ſhould rather have made them againſt the King, then the Parliament</hi> is eaſily beleived, for its knowne to all the world they did riſe againſt the king vpon pretence of regai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their nationall liberties from the Engliſh oppreſſion, as they called it, and ſince the Libeller ſeeth ſoe apparent an Argument of their riſing againſt the king, its blinde madnes to ſuſpect their riſing for the king. The Parliament then pretended to act for the king, and that the Rebellion was againſt him, not themſelves, but the man deſerts his Arguments, and falls to his old common place, and will ſuſpect the king, becauſe <hi>he vſed the Prelaticall Religion, and to force it vpon others made Epiſcopall, Ceremoniall, and common prayer booke warrs.</hi> Such men, as made warrs, and rayſed Rebellion to take away the order of Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopps, Ceremonies, and booke of Common prayer eſtabliſhed by lawes in the Raignes of beſt Princes with the advice of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent confeſſours, and Martyrs of the age, wherein they lived confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Scripture, and pureſt times of the Church, declare to the whole world, that they have neither ſhame, truth, nor Religion, and are juſtly ſtigmatized for making not only Epiſcopall, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and common prayer booke warrs, but Antichriſtian, and Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Rebellion.</p>
               <p>That the Papiſts knew <hi>theſe warrs were their warrs</hi> may eaſily be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived, for they muſt needes apprehend advantage from the Rebellion But its well knowne, that the Papiſts are more jealous of Epiſcopacie, Ceremonies, and booke of common prayer, as they ſtand reformed in the Church of England, then of the Directory, Extemporall devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, independent, or Preſbiterall platformes, that have noe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Scripture, or the doctrine, or practice of the ancient Church, but what is this to the prepoſterous rigour, and vncharitable fury, that he would juſtifie? Does he meane, that the extirpation of the Iriſh was the ſole way to ſuppreſſe open Idolatry, and is this <hi>what we may doe Evangecally to be their Reformers?</hi> Is blood, &amp; maſſacre Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reformation, &amp; is kill, and reforme the ſame thinge? As that rigour obſerved by his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> was altogeather vnpolitique, ſoe if it were intended in order to Religion, it was moſt abominable, ſuch Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres being the deſignes of irreligious perſecutours, not Evangelicall Reformers, who though they <hi>feare</hi> not their adverſaries, yet will not give them cauſe of ſcandall, nor deſperation, and ſuch, as make deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their Reformation, ſhew they feare men, whome they ſeeke to kill, not God, whome preſumptuouſly, and hipocritically they pretend to ſerve.</p>
               <p>His inſtance of King James is as impertinent, as ſcurrilous, that <hi>after the powder plot King Iames durſt never doe other, then equivoiate, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95058:107"/>collegue with the Pope, &amp; bis adherents.</hi> Doth this viper beleive, the Pope, or his adherents had any ſuch thoughts? Was the writing againſt the the Pope a Colloguinge? The many invectives of Popiſh writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him ſignifie the plaine contrary; beſides the lawes made by him againſt Popiſh recuſants ſhew, that the Author was in one of his luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique tranſes, when he dreamt of that <hi>heckticke trembling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The retarding, and delayes of releife to Ireland againſt that Rebellion,</hi> were ſoe apparently diſcovered to proceede from the faction in Parliament, that there reſts not the leaſt colour to charge it vpon the King. They converted the ſubjects money, and other preparations for the releife of Ireland to the rayſing of the Rebellion in England, and they hindred the going over of a new governour into that kingdome, becauſe they would vſe his helpe to their deſignes at home.</p>

                  <hi>They were diffident to trust the King with an army, and therefore refuſed his offer to goe in perſon againſt the Rebells.</hi> It ſeemes they had litle compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on that people, that preferred their jealoſies before their pittie, &amp; it is a plaine Treaſon, and encouragement to that Rebellion to pretend diſtruſt of their King, and ſhewes they ſought their owne perſonall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie before the remedie of that Rebellion, &amp; the ſafetie of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. His <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> might juſtly finde fault with thoſe, who threatned all extreamitie to the Rebells, and they, that exclude all mercy to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſingle perſon, where multitudes are involved, and ſuch, as followed Abſolom with a ſimple heart, ſhew neither humanitie, nor Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when <hi>Fathers Brothers, Wives, and Children were deſtroyed by ſuch an occaſion,</hi> neither is <hi>Magiſtracie, and warr vnder the goſpell</hi> giuded by ſuch paſſions, but by the rules of Chriſtian pittie, and ſuch as give themſelves the licence of vniverſall Maſſacres, will not abſtaine from embruing their hands in the blood of their Fathers, Brothers, Wives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſparing neither ancient, nor ſuckling, King, nor Prieſt, defacing, all Monuments of Chriſtianitie, and turning Religion into the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their hirelings, and all devotion into ſquint eyes, and diſfigured faces, and erect an Empire in themſelves with the ſlaughter of all, that ſubmitt not to them.</p>
               <p>The repetition of <hi>making the warr</hi> by the King in England, is his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicon againſt all exceptions, and <hi>Gewgawes of the Crowne, and Copes, and ſurpliſſes, and ſuch trinketts,</hi> he thinkes are names to ſublimate his braine ſicke Sectaries into their frenetique fitt, and make them cry out greate are the Calves of their vnknowne Religion, whither they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the wiſedome of God vnder the law, &amp; his mercy vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and will rather wade through the blood of their Country, then endure power in the King, or decencie in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is greate difference betweene the inſtances of the deſtruction of the ſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemites, and the diſciples calling, for fire from heaven againſt the Citie, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed lodging, and this of a nation by juſt warr, &amp; execution to ſlay whole fame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95058:107"/>of them, who had ſtaine whole families before.</hi> But where lies the odds, there was aſmuch threatned to the Irish, as was done to the ſichemites? Though there were a difference betweene the ſins of ſome, there was noe difference betweene the innocence of many, and there is noe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene them, that will deſtroy promiſcuouſly without mercy, where all are not guiltie in the one caſe, and the other. But why doth not the Libeller ſtate his caſe right, and inſteede of families ſett downe the whole nation, as the truth was? Did he ſhrinke at the expreſſion of the truth at large, and name families to diminiſh the guilt?</p>
               <p>That, which <hi>was done againſt the Benjamites,</hi> was by Gods revealed will in that particular Caſe, and yet there was a remnant reſerved of them; that eſcaped the preſent ſtroake of the warr, and they returned againe to their poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>The Libeller ſayes, <hi>he ſpeakes not this, that ſuch meaſure ſhould be meated to all the Iriſh, or as remembring, that the Parliament ever ſoe decreed.</hi> But if they did ſoe, then this ſhall ſerve for their juſtification, for to what end els is it, that he offers excuſes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſhew, that this homily,</hi> (meaning it ſeemes the Kings diſcourſe) <hi>hath more of craft, and affectation, then ſound doctrine.</hi> But either it is ſound doctrine, or elſe the Libeller muſt juſtifie the contrary, to which he ſayes that which he ſpeakes is not intended, and that, which he hath brought ſhewes, that the homily he intends is found Doctrine, and his intended oppoſition ſignifies nothing, but his owne corruption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King would have ſome puniſhed,</hi> which he ſayes <hi>were of leaſt vſe, and muſt of neceſſitie have been ſacrifiſed to his reputation.</hi> And can he thinke, that the king cauſed the Rebellion, and yet would puniſh any for his reputation, might they not then produce it? and how then could he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifiſe them to his reputation, which would be more wounded by the puniſhing of one, then the ſparing of all.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes, <hi>ſome were to be pretected vpon their ſubmiſſion from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe, who would ſoone drowne them, if they refuſed to ſwim downe the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular ſtreame with them.</hi> The Libeller ſayes <hi>that fury is applyed to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> If ſuch were their condition, its not miſapplyed.</p>
               <p>The Libeller ſayes, <hi>he remembers not they had ſoe decreed,</hi> &amp; if not, how could it be applyed to them? And wherefore doth he except to the ſoundnes of the doctrine, if it concerned them not?</p>
               <p>Thoſe, who would not ſwim downe the ſtreame <hi>are Papiſts, Prelates, and their faction.</hi> He meanes not Engliſh Prelates, for they have not yet been charged with the Iriſh Rebellion, and if he meane the Romiſh Prelates, it were ſuperfluous, having named Papiſts before, and why doth he ſay, that he ſpeakes not, that ſuch meaſure ſhould be meated to all the Iriſh, when he would have the king eſteemed a favourer of the Jriſh Rebellion, if he protected any Iriſh Papiſts vpon their ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For he ſayes, <hi>by this, who ſees not, that he, and the Iriſh Rebells had but
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95058:108"/>one aime.</hi> And whoever thinkes he ſees it by this hath neither ſight, nor reaſon, and there is nothing to be ſeene in the Libellers inference, but exceſſive impudence, and falſhood.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes, <hi>ſome kinde of zeale is not ſeldome more greedy to kill the Beare for his ſkin, then for any harme he hath done.</hi> This the Libeller ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>our zeale,</hi> and would inferre from thence, <hi>that the Parliamentis more bloody in the proſecution of their Iuſtice, then the Rebells in their crueltie.</hi> And by what conſtruction can he make that good? may there not be by ends in a judge, &amp; yet his ſentence not ſoe bloody, as a malefactours Cryme, &amp; he, that charges a Magiſtrate with a wrong end in giving a Juſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, doth not diminiſh the Cryme of the malefactour. Can any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall ſoule conclude vpon the Kings diſlike of irregular proceedings againſt the Iriſh, that he excuſed their Cryme? This is chaffe to caſt in the eyes of his bleerde Sectaries, for none elſe are ſoe purblinde, and there neede noe diſpute, that the King perfectly hated the Iriſh Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, &amp; juſtly cenſured the proceeding in that vnſeaſonable threatning of deſtruction. The inſtance of the beares ſkin was made by a member of the lower houſe at the time, when they debated that buſines, and yet they then thought it noe favour to the Iriſh, nor cenſure of their owne proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ceſſation, which the King made was in favour of the Iriſh, and without the advice of Parliament, to whome he had committed the managing of that warr.</hi> The King plainely deſcerned, that the deſigne of the faction in Parliament in managing the Iriſh warrs was only to draw money from the people vnder that pretence to ſubdue England, and deſtroy him by taking away al aſſiſtance from him, and thence proceedes their Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vpon the ceſſation; and their willfull neglect, and diverſion of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours amidſt the reiterated Cryes of the proteſtants in that Kingdome, the importunitie of the Lords Juſtices, and the viſible growth of the Enemy ſhewes the advantage they made of that Rebellion, &amp; the King was bound in Juſtice, and honour to preſerve that Kingdome, and in Chriſtian pittie to releive his diſtreſſed ſubjects, which he could not doe without reſuminge the managing of that warr, which had been ſoe Treacherouſly miſcarried by thoſe he truſted, &amp; as he made that ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the advice, &amp; intreatie of his proteſtant ſubjects there, ſoe they were ſufficient wittneſſes of the low condition themſelves were in, and the power of the Rebells.</p>
               <p>But the Libeller would prove, that <hi>the Proteſtants there were on the winning hand,</hi> becauſe <hi>they kept their owne not withſtanding the miſſe of thoſe forces, which were landed in walls, and Cheſhire, who without difficultie Maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a greate part of theſe Countreyes.</hi> The Proteſtants keeping of their owne was by the benifitt of that ceſſation, without which they hoped not to keepe it, and thoſe Countreyes of walls, and Cheſhire were not maſtered by thoſe forces, as the Libeller ſuppoſes, but protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95058:108"/>by them againſt the Tyrany of the Rebellion then entring vpon them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Declaration,</hi> which he vouches for proofe is an infamy to the Authors, conteyning neither colour of proofe, nor ſoundnes of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of as litle creditt, as his owne aſſertions. In the meane time thoſe forces of the Proteſtants, which the king gott by that ceſſation declare to the world, that the Iriſh Rebellion croſſed his ends, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced thoſe of the Engliſh Rebells.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The way-laying of proviſions</hi> was contradicted by ſuch apparent proofes in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> anſweares, that vntill they make ſome reply to thoſe particulars, their clamours will ſignifie nothing but want of matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The forces he called over ſtood him in noe ſmall ſteede againſt our maine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> That noe way hinders, but that they might be termed <hi>handfulls</hi> in reſpect of the numerous Rebells both in Ireland, &amp; England. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the ceſſation, beſides the knowne evidence of truth, and weight have an addition of Authoritie from the Libellers calling them falſe, and frivolous without the leaſt ſhew of reaſon, it being his cuſtome to ſtile truth, and reaſon by ſuch Titles.</p>
               <p>He reprehends the king <hi>for likening his puniſhments to Iobs Tryalls, before he ſaw them have Iobs endings.</hi> And vpon the ſame reaſon he will not allow the Tryalls of the Martirs to have a likenes to Jobs, becauſe the end in reſpect of Temporall felicitie was not the ſame.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes, he hath not <hi>leiſure to make prolix Apologies,</hi> from whence the libeller concludes <hi>thoſe long declarations, and Remonſtrances,</hi> which he calls <hi>Pamphletts ſet out in his name were none of his.</hi> And is not on of the cruell deſignes of the Traytours had noe leiſure to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix Apologies, therefore the declarations, and Remonſtrances publiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed by him, while he was at libertie were none of his. The king hath given ſufficient Teſtimony to ſtopp the mouth af a deſtractour, that noe writings, publiſhed in his name were above his abilitie. If his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations were weightie, and juſt, why are they Pamphletts? if not why, will not the Libeller believe him the Author whome he ſeeks to vilifie, but the world knowes the declarations in the name of Parliament were none of theirs, but voted vpon the word of a junto by ſuch as had not capacitie, to vnderſtand them.</p>
               <p>That <hi>though the Common ſaying, that it is Kingly to doe well, and heare ill be ſometimes true, yet more frequently to doe ill, and heare well by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of flatterers, that deifie the name of Kings.</hi> It can hardly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ever evill king had ſoe many flatterers, as the beſt kings have detractours, and himſelfe produces inſtances, how the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude deified Simon Mountford, and ſuch popular brovillions againſt their kings.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:95058:109"/>
               <p>For <hi>the peace in Ireland,</hi> the Juſtice of it is now apparent, and he, that pardons Rebells to ſave the effuſion of the blood of his good ſubjects, ſhewes greater tendernes to the good, then they, that by endeavouring to exclude all from mercy, expoſe them promiſcuouſly to mutuall ſlaughter, and may juſtly be judged to looke vpon both with an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent eye, and that neither Juſtice, nor pittie, but greedy, and rapacious diſires carry them to that crueltie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King prayes at large for the Iriſh Rebells.</hi> It ſeemes Charitie for Enemies is held a ſin by theſe miſcreants, otherwiſe he would not have cenſured a prayer ſoe becoming a Chriſtian, that God would not give over <hi>the whole ſtocke of that ſeduced nation to the wrath of thoſe, whoſe cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſnes makes them cruell, nor to their anger, which is too feirce, and therefore juſtly curſed.</hi> The King deprecates the Rebellion of Ireland, and in his prayer concludes his innocence, and that if he had not ſtudied the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the differences ſayes, <hi>let thy hand be vpon me, &amp; my fathers houſe.</hi> And this the Libeller calls a ſolemne Curſe, which is his judgment of the Cryme, and the aſſertion of his innocence. Though God afflict his ſervants, his hand is not againſt them in wrath, as this wretch preſumes to ſay, and lookes not on that curſe, which God denounces againſt bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and deceitefull men, that pretend his ſervice in the deſtruction of his ſervants.</p>

               <p>HE, that obſerves how greate a part of this Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers booke his invectives againſt Monarchy take vp, &amp; how frequently, and impertinently he offers his exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Kingly Government in excuſe of falſhood, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, may well wonder at his exceptions to pretended repetitions, in the Kings booke he enters vpon this Chapter with his opinion of the originall of Kings <hi>to be ſervants of the publique.</hi> And yet the people were ſubjects to them, and how farr Kings miſtake the nature of their office, <hi>that thinke they are Maſters of the people.</hi> And yet God gave nations to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95058:109"/>ſerve them. Though their power is for publique good, yet they have a peculiar proprietie in that power, and Eſtate, as private men in their private fortunes, &amp; its more for the peoples good to be ſubject, though to an evill King, then to fall to confuſion. And if rulers may not retaine their power, becauſe factious multitudes ſay, that they are but intruſted for the peoples good, &amp; that it is for the peoples good, that they yeilde vp the ſword, they bare it in vaine. Such a wooden ſword have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells provided for all Rulers, but themſelves, for when they get power by their ſwords of ſteele, or mines of powder the people may not thinke, that they ſhall finde ſuch Lords of ſtraw, as they pretend gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the people ought to be. We are taught by Scripture, that the people are commaunded to hearken, and obey, not teach, &amp; commaund, and though his ſuppoſition, that Government is in the people, and that they ordained Kings be vaine, and falſe by the examples of Scripture, and of moſt Authenticke hiſtories, yet were it admitted, that a King came in by the peoples conſent, they are not after ſuch ſubmiſſion Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their owne obedience, or their Kings power.</p>
               <p>It were vaine to follow the Libeller in his exceptions to <hi>the words of favour, and gratification, as ſounding pride, and Lordly vſurpation,</hi> as if kings only had nothing in their power to oblidge men with all, theſe are the ſpleenetique vapours of Rebellious diſtemper.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Kings conceſſions to the Scotts, either</hi> touching <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> or the <hi>Militia,</hi> wee ſhall heare his anſweare in due time, howſoever the king was not bound to the ſame Actions, where Circumſtances varied, nor after a fuller vnderſtanding of the nature, and conſequence of the things graunted, and as his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> profeſſed a cleerer information af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe Actions had paſſed him, ſoe he evidently ſaw, that they were more againſt his ſubjects good, then his owne, and that inſteede of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting an Arbitrary power, it would have introduced an arbitrary li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and confuſion into the Kingdome, and ſuch men, as preferre the bondage of popular confuſion, or the licentious inſolence of many Lords, are eyther inchanted with a witch craft of Rebellion, or ſtupid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benummed with a ſenſeles Lethargy.</p>
               <p>With what Zeale the Libeller reproves the abuſe of Scripture, when he exclaimes, as if it offended his conſcience, we may perceive by the alluſion he makes ſaying. <hi>Ireland was as Ephraim, the ſtrength of his head,</hi> meaning the Kings, <hi>Scotland, as Iudah was his law giver, but over England, as over Edom he meant to cast his ſhooe.</hi> Hath this man reverence to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the Author of it?</p>
               <p>He comes againe to accuſe the King for perſecuting <hi>the conſciences of Religious men,</hi> a knowne vntruth, yet ſoe much beloved by the Libeller, as he ſeemes impatient to miſſe the repetition of it, and with this he joynes his reproving the Kings profeſſion <hi>of being an Enemy of thoſe, that forced the conſcience</hi> becauſe <hi>he had made a warr, and loſt all, rather then not
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:95058:110"/>vphold the Biſhopps.</hi> It is an Argument, that he eſteemed his conſcience, that loſt all for it. But the Libeller ſayes, they were <hi>perſecuting Biſhopps.</hi> The King vpholding Biſhopps, vpholds not perſecution, or abuſe, and the Libellers confounding the office, &amp; ill exerciſe of it makes knowne his want of Argument. The falſhood of their Calumnies againſt the Biſhopps is ſufficiently manifeſted to the world, that after ſoe many vehement outcryes they have not proved on ſuch act of perſecution done by any one of them, &amp; not the preſons but the office, &amp; lawe were the perſecution in this mans judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King obtruded new Ceremonies vpon vs, vpon the Scotts a new Liturgie</hi> There were noe new Ceremonies obtruded by him in England, and this horrid Rebellion to take away the Ceremonies, and Government legally eſtabliſhed, and continually practiſed, vnder the name of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, detects both the fraude, and outrage of their proceedings. The new leiturgie offred the Scots by advice of their Biſhopps, and Clergie, was an act befitting the care of a King, and noe man will beleive, that it was an offence te their conſciences, who made noe conſcience of blood, and Rebellion vpon pretence of their conſcience, which the world ſees was an hipocriticall ſtraining at a ſtraw, and ſwallowing a Camell, and theſe tender conſcience men have written their tendernes of conſcience with the blood of their brethren; which will remaine a memoriall of their diſſembled ſanctitie.</p>
               <p>What <hi>hinderance of the ſearch of truth,</hi> he meanes is not vnderſtood, vnles he would have the dreames of mad ſectaries confirmed by authoritie.</p>
               <p>He would have the penalties of lawes thought perſecution of the conſcience, and ſectaries the Judges, and ſayes, <hi>if himſelfe</hi> (meaning the King) <hi>and his learned Churchmen were the obſtinate part, ſhould Reformation ſuffer them to ſit Lording like the greate whore?</hi> And are ſectaries Libells convictions of Kings, and learned Churchmen, and the clamours of malefactours a ſentence againſt the Judge? Such is the Government, that muſt now rule the world, and Reformation muſt be an Idoll in the hands of a ſeditious ſectarie, whereto the people muſt fall downe, and ſuch vnſtable multitudes carried about with every winde of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine are likely to be thoſe many waters, on which the greate whore ſits, which hath for corruption, and crueltie a greate reſemblance vnto thoſe falſe prophetts, that now ſeduce the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe Clergimen were not to bedriven like ſheepe, but driven out like wolves.</hi> But they are theeves, and wolves, that enter into the ſheepefold by violence, and ſtealth, and the ambition, and greedines of theſe wolves will finde occaſion to ſucke the blood, and devoure the fleſh of the ſheepe.</p>
               <p>The king ſayes, <hi>that he beleives the Preſbiterie, though proved to be the only inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſt, were not by the ſword to be ſet vp without his conſent, which is contrary</hi> ſaith the Libeller, <hi>both to the doctrine, and knowne
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95058:110"/>practice of all Proteſtant Churches, if his ſword threaten thoſe, who of their owne accord imbrace it.</hi> But then it, cannot be ſett vp by the ſword, vnles his ſword threaten thoſe, that imbrace it; And this jugler denies, what the king ſayes, and yet in effect profeſſes it, and while he enrages the Tumults to ſett vp their Preſbiterie with the ſword produces Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only for defence. The reformed Churches profeſſe to follow the ancients in ſuffering, not aſſociate themſelves to bloody Sectaries in Rebelling. And his next words impert that private men may not contend with Magiſtrates, nor vſe force againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though Chriſt, and his Apoſtles being to Civill affaires but private men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not with Magiſtrates, yet when Magiſtrates themſelves, and eſpecially Parliament come to know Religion they ought to defend it againſt any King, or Tyrant.</hi> What is defence to the queſtion in hand of ſetting vp Religion by the ſword without the kings conſent? May an inferiour Chriſtian Magiſtrate take Armes againſt his ſuperiour a Pagan to ſett vp Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Is he not as much a private man as our Saviour, and his Apoſtles, where the Civill power hath not given him a right? And as a Civill right is not imaginable, ſoe the pretence of a power from Religion is execrable, and falſe which will not permitt an vſurpation vpon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill right. There may be a King, where there is noe Parliament, and it is noe more lawfull for an inferiour Migiſtrate, or to Parliament, who are but private men in regard of the Prince, whoſe deputies they are to take the ſword to ſett vp Religion againſt the King their ſoveraigne, then for any private men, and were not the libeller diſtracted betweene evidence of truth, and his owne corrupt inclinations, he would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the name of Magiſtrates, and Parliament, that but the line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pretended the power of <hi>the people to</hi> doe the ſame thing by the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and practice of all Proteſtant Churches, and would make them more publique perſons, then their Saviour, and his Apoſtles, he thinkes his reviling language of <hi>Tyrany,</hi> and <hi>bloody Biſhopps,</hi> and the <hi>King their pupill</hi> are irrefragable Arguments in the judgment of his pubills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a large difference betweene forcing men by the ſword to turne Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterians, and defending them, who willingly are ſoe.</hi> But then it is impious to force ment to be ſoe, what thoſe wretches did to the King for not being ſoe, and for not conſenting to impoſe it, vpon the kingdome by a law, the world knowes, and the world is wittnes, and they have robbed men of their poſſeſſions by the ſword to ſett vp this new Religion.</p>
               <p>His charging <hi>Covetuouſnes, and ambition to be the events of Epiſcopacy,</hi> is ſchiſmaticall malice, for Epiſcopacie in the beginning of the Church was attended with povertie, and perſecution, but the libeller will make Martirdome their ambition, and wants their Covetuouſnes.</p>
               <p>He will have, that <hi>Engliſh Epiſcopacie hath markes of ſchiſme, whether we looke at Apoſtolicke times, or reformed Churches,</hi> if he had ſhewed wherein, it had deſerved an anſweare, but we ſee what Apoſtolicke
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95058:111"/>times he meanes, that will not allow any Church of the world from the time of the Apoſtles til the preſent age, &amp; becauſe the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is not vniverſall, therefore all Sectaries may pretend themſelves the Church.</p>
               <p>For the authoritie of Scripture, he needed not take paines to prove it. The Church of England claimes not power over other Churches, but to correct Schiſmatickes within her ſelfe. The expoſition of Scripture may not be received from arrogant Sectaries againſt the judgment of the vniverſall Church, &amp; the King might very well reject ſuch reaſons, as they, which offered them, had ſoe lately before diſavowed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended themſelves ſcandalized with the imputation of ſuch opinions.

And it is evident, that they, who vſe noe ſet formes in publique prayer, direct them more to the hearers, then to God, ſtudying for expreſſions of their owne parts, while others, that vſe ſet formes have their affections more enlarged, and not yoked to the ſearch of words.</p>

               <p>For the <hi>varietie of words,</hi> though God have given vs plentie, and that we ought not <hi>to be nigardly of them to him alone,</hi> yet we finde long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, and vaine repetitions condemned by God, and we are commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when we come before him, that our words be few, and <hi>the queſting of Scripture Phraſe in prayers</hi> is now found wanting in leiturgies, that was ſoe lately ſcorned by the libeller for <hi>the lipp worke of every Prelaticall lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgiſt.</hi> Sectaries prayers, though dreſſed with varietie of words are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compained with a nigardly devotion, wherein God cheifely requires vs to be copious, &amp; this libeller is copious in blaſphemy, that wil have the word of God, if whorded vp, and injoyn'd to breed wormes, &amp; ſtinke.</p>
               <p>The libeller would have his ſcoffes received for Argument, &amp; to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the vſe of ſett formes brings in the <hi>famine of the ſeidge of Ieruſalem,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prieſts <hi>brought ſtill the ſame loaves of the ſhewbread,</hi> not being able to procure new, &amp; he would give vs ſtones for bread, the Phariſees ſtill continue their old leaven of hipocriſie, though their words be varyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Lords prayer had been a warrant for leiturgies, why was neither that, nor other ſet forme after vſed mentioned by the Apoſtles, or comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to our vſe.</hi> It had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very needeleſly preſcribed by our ſaviour, if it had never bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſed afterwards, &amp; it had been diſobedience in the Apoſtles, if they did not vſe it, being by our ſaviour commaunded.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95058:117"/>of God, and we cannot pretend want of revelation in this point, where we have ſuch expreſſe preſcription of the Lords prayer, and particular injunctions of the Apoſtle St. Paul, and if we muſt expect ſuch revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where is it revealed that every congregation muſt vſe only ſuch words, as the Miniſter thereof extemporally dictates in their prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If God left our words to be putt into vs without premeditation,</hi> why then doth the Libeller allow any mans private infirmitie to vſe helpes? will not God help private infirmitie that way, Or is every one in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation without infirmitie.

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Affections grow laſy in ſet prayer, and come not vp eaſily at the call of words.</hi> But much more eaſily, then in the labour for words, and matter, and thoſe words are moſt emptie of devotion, and prayer, which are the oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of the preſenters abilities, who is apt to ſeeke ſatisfaction in contemplation of his owne parts, and his fervour is greater in looking on himſelfe, then God.</p>

That there was a Leiturgie in the Church, of the Jewes hath not been denyed by any learned man, &amp; its apparent by the Titles of many of Davids Pſalmes, that they were vſed by the ſingers in the ordinary ſervice of the Church. That Chriſtians vſed the Lords prayer, and other ſett formes cannot be denyed, and the Libeller is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his computation of the time, when Leiturgies begun, for the Church never wanted them, and we have ſeene by experience, that <hi>true pietie,</hi> followed the vſe of Leiturgies, diſobedience, and prophanes the rejection of them, &amp; ſuch, as have rejected them, have proved not only <hi>Truants,</hi> but Apoſtates to all ſanctitie.</p>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:95058:119"/>only falſe, and hipocriticall factioniſts, which outwardly profeſſing the eſtabliſhed Religion ſought for gaine, and pride, ſecretly to draw diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after them to the diſturbance, &amp; ſubverſion of the Church. There needes not any thing be ſaid to his rayling, his corruption being appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by objecting it to the calling of Biſhopps, and hates it, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt ſchiſme, which the Church had by them.</p>
               <p>The King <hi>beſtowed livings</hi> according to the law, and the Policie was not his, but the ancient conſtitution of the Church, and this Monſter, that reproaches the retaining any thing in Leiturgie, or Government practiſed by the ancient Church is not aſhamed to charge the king with breach of Canons, and the ancient practice of the Church in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Eccleſiaſticall dignities, and the peoples right in Elections was never pretended in England, and juſtly, and anciently forbidden in the Church, neither doe any Canons in force ſupport that pretence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That influence, which</hi> the king ſayes <hi>is neceſſarie for the Prince to have vpon Churchmen,</hi> noe man, that beleives the Scripture will thinke vnfitt, but how can the Libeller make good, that the many Emperours, and <hi>Kings,</hi> that imbraced the Chriſtian Religion <hi>hated, and feared it,</hi> for ſoe they muſt by his grounds? And how can he conclude from Pagans hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Religion, that it was only from their kings, when as the ſtories are ſoe plentifull in ſetting downe the madd rage of the multitude, the truth is ſeditious innovatours know, that their hopes, and ſtrength lie to ſeduce the ſilly people, and that it is the intereſt of governours, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their lewde endeavours, and thence proceede their declamations againſt Rulers, and their proclamations of Libertie, and that, which they cal the Biſhopps Tyrany is only their office to take away ſchiſme, and ſchiſme is the way to Rebellion.</p>
               <p>The Libellers judgment touching <hi>callings</hi> founded on Scripture, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> or <hi>graces</hi> of the Biſhopps, and others is of the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as the determinations of Traytours touching loyaltie, and heretic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes touching ſound doctrine, and his end never agrees with his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but in rayling, and incongruitie, for but now he made it the Kings Policie to hire the Biſhopps, &amp; now it is the <hi>Biſhopps</hi> Policie to worke that perſwaſion in the King <hi>of noe Biſhopp, noe King,</hi> the man well knowes, that noe Biſhopp, noe king was the perſwaſion, of King James, who found it true by his owne experience without the helpe of Biſhopps, and vet ſoe ſottiſh doth this Libeller preſume his readers, that makes the dependence, which Biſhopps have only of the king the cauſe of ſuch perſwaſions, &amp; <hi>yet in their owne ſubtill ſenſe, they were of another minde,</hi> how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could their dependence be a cauſe of their perſwaſion, or was their ſenſe ſubtill, and groſſely miſtaken. Thus thoſe blattering devills, that in the beginning of the Parliament charged the Biſhopps, to be Antimonarchicall thereby to conceale their malice againſt the king, now make it their Cryme to favour Monarchy.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:95058:119"/>
               <p>He hath found a very ſtrong proofe, as he would have it out of the Hiſtorie of the Councell of Trent, that <hi>Biſhopps are moſt potent, when Princes are weakeſt,</hi> that argues not their dependence vpon Princes, nor that averſion to Biſhopps is not averſion to Princes, it was ſpoken of Biſhopps depending on the Pope, not on Princes, and ſuch Clergy men, as have their dependence on Pope, or people wil never wiſh, that the king ſhould be potent to maſter their dependencie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From this the King ſett himſelfe to the removall of thoſe men, whoſe doctrine he feared would be the vndoing of Monarchy.</hi> And needed he the Councells of Biſhopps to provide for his ſafetie againſt ſuch men? And is that the evill intereſt of Tyrany, and Epiſcopacie to prevent the deſignes of Traytours? Who were Traytours, if they were not, that would vndoe Monarchy? The doctrine, and deſignes of the ſchiſmatickes are heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by apparent to be againſt Monarchy, and yet the prevention of ſuch conſpiracies is the Tyrany, and the corrupt Councells of Biſhopps, which the hipocrites cry out on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Noe temporall law could touch the innocencie of their lives.</hi> And had they innocency, that plotted the vndoing of Monarchy vnder which they lived, and could not the law touch it? Their diſobedience to lawes was a Cryme inconſiſtent with innocence, and muſt neceſſarily be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the lawes they diſobey, and that, which he calls <hi>perſecution of their conſciences, and laying ſcandalls before them</hi> was only the requiring of their obedience to Acts of Parliament, whoſe authoritie he ſoe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cryes vp, and the inflicting of juſt <hi>penalties</hi> on their <hi>bodies, and Eſtates</hi> according to the lawes was the dutie of the Magiſtrate, to whome the execution of them belonged, although the indulgence they found from his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> in mitigating the penalties of law was a greate cauſe of their inſolence, and that Calamitie they have brought vpon the kingdome, and if the lives of theſe men be ſought into, their pride, impudence, calumnie, lying, perjurie, covetuouſnes, and crueltie declare their lives farr from innocent.</p>
               <p>The man now breakes out into a thankeſgiving for the ſucceſſes of their Rebellion, and though theſe hipocrites deſpiſe the thought of a Church, and have noe Communion with any Church, ancient, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, yet the reſiſtance of them is <hi>warr againſt the Church.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>They could not be Apoſtles,</hi> his reaſon is, becauſe <hi>that of Apoſtle was vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, extraordinary, and immediate, the other ordinary fixed, and particular charge, and inſpection.</hi> The calling of the ſeventie diſciples was vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, extraordinarie, and immediate, and yet they were noe Apoſtles, and becauſe callings were at firſt extraordinary, muſt not they, whoſe office it was to provide Succeſſours to themſelves, and others in the Church of God, ordaine others into their functions, and is it an Argument, that becauſe, when the Church was gathered, men had particular care of certaine Churches, therefore they were not of the ſame calling with others, that preceeded them in gathering theſe Churches, and the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of territorie in the exerciſe of a mans calling doth not make diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the function.</p>
               <p>It is againſt reaſon, and Charitie to ſuppoſe an <hi>ignorance, and deviation</hi> of the ancient Church taught by the Apoſtles in a point, that deſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed the calling of ſuch, as were to reproach the goſpell, and the <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſſe</hi> is not imaginable in the introduction of Prelacy, vnles by Apoſtolicall conſtitution in regard of the vniverſalitie, and the Author cannot name any manifeſt corruption ſo ſudden, and vniverſall after the Apoſtles, though he pretend many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie proves it cleerely to be falſe, that noe example ſince the firſt age for</hi> 1500 <hi>yeares can be produced of any ſetled Church, wherein were many Miniſters, and congregations, which had ſome Biſhopps over them.</hi> And his proofe is out of Sozomen, who, he ſayes, wrote above 1200 <hi>yeares agoe,</hi> and his Teſtimony, that in the Churches of Cyprus, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia they had Biſhopps in every village, what then? he ſayes <hi>what could theſe be more then Preſbiters?</hi> Yes they were Biſhopps, for doth any man doubt, that Biſhopps, and Preſbiters were not diſtinct in Sozomens time, who ſoe frequently mentions it, and the Libeller complaines of the corruption of introducing them in the ages foregoing, there are many Councells before Sozomen, which were vniverſally received, and in them ſubordinate of Preſbiter to Biſhopp is the vndeniable
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:95058:120"/>practice of the Church, and the quantitie, or quallitie of Townes, or Territories, wherein Biſhopps were placed, noe way proves the leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their order, neither can it be collected, becauſe Biſhopps were in ſmall villages, that therefore they were noe other then Preſbiters, but heerein the Libeller ſhewes his malicious oppſition to truth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing Sozomen, who having ſaid, that Churches had ſeveral cuſtomes, &amp; inſtances, that though there were many Citties in Scithia, there was one Biſhopp only over all, and in other Countreyes Biſhopps were in villages, not every village, &amp; he might aswell conclude noe Preſbiters in Scithia, as none, but Preſbiters in Arabia, and Cyprus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſame Author tells the like of other nations, and that Epiſcopall Churches did not condemne them.</hi> Wherefore ſhould they condemne them? Its like they would, if they had taken vpon them to exerciſe the calling of Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopps being but Presbiters, for that was long before condemned by the Canons.</p>
               <p>He makes a large leape from ſozomen to fower hundred yeares agoe, and the he ſayes <hi>many weſterne Churches in France, Piedmont, and Bohemia admitted not of Epiſcopacy among them,</hi> and yet the doctrine, and practice of theſe Churches publiſhed by themſelves is, that they had Biſhopps, &amp; continue them ſtil, &amp; this the libeller might ſee in their own bookes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If we might beleive what Papiſts have written of the Waldenſes,</hi> he findes <hi>in a booke written</hi> 400 <hi>yeares ſince, that thoſe Churches in Piedmont held the ſame doctrine ſince the time, that Conſtantine with his miſcheivous donations poyſened,</hi> Thus the exploded forgery of conſtantines donation is made authenticke to reproach the Church, <hi>Sylveſter, and the whole Church.</hi> This is the Schiſmaticall Charitie to the firſt Chriſtian, Emperour, and the whole Church, but the man might have remembred, that Biſhopps by his owne confeſſion were long before the time of Conſtantine, and if we beleive the waldenſes themſelves, they had Biſhopps in their Churches, who held the ſame doctrine, and Government, and the antiquitie of the waldenſes proves, that they had Biſhopps, otherwiſe they had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the ancient Church, as Aerius, was, for if there had been any Churches, differing from vniverſal practice in the time of Conſtantine, it is not imaginable, that they had been vnobſerved, &amp; wee finde noe mention of their diſſent, but from the Papacie, and that long after.</p>
               <p>The famous Teſtimonie of St. Jerome, whereto he referrs the reſt is farr from <hi>declaring openly,</hi> that Biſhopp, and Preſbiter are the ſame thing, but the contrary is manifeſt in him, for what proofe can there be drawne from ſaint Jerome, that Biſhopps, &amp; Preſbiters were the ſame thing, who ſaies, that befor ſchiſme by inſtigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the devil entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, &amp; that one ſaid I am of Paul, another of Apollo, another of cephas, al things were governed by the common counſel of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters, and who will thinke, that there were no diſtinct orders, becauſe things were governed by the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> counſel of Presbiters, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95058:121"/>ſchiſmes began, and when things were ſoe governed, were there not Apoſtles in the Church, and ſuperiour to Preſbiters?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Ierome affirmes, that Biſhopps rather by cuſtome, then ordainement of Chriſt were exalted above Preſbiters.</hi> St Ierome ſpeakes of priviledges gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Biſhopps above Preſbiters by cuſtome, but he affirmes the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of ordination belonging to them, and not to Preſbiters Though St. Ierome make a difference betwixt the ordainment of Chriſt, and the practice of the Apoſtles, neither he, nor any good Chriſtian ever queſtioned the lawfullnes, &amp; authoritie of ſuch Cuſtome of the Church in the times of the Apoſtles, and this man, that in this very Chapter ſaid the King produced noe Scripture, and that antiquitie was not of weight againſt it, now gravely determines that interpretation of St. Ierome in his ſenſe ſhalbe received before <hi>intricate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If it be farr <hi>beyound Court Element</hi> what is ſaid by his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> it is not above his owne, the proper Element of this breaker is prophanes, and impudence, and heere againe he importunately obtrudes the Kings let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Pope, which he makes a cheife ſupport of his Trayterous pretences, but the authoritie of a gazet out of which he quotes it, is too meane to rayſe a ſcandall vpon a Prince in the judgment of any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men, and this man well knowes the fraude in publiſhing that falſe Copie of the Kings letter, which he willfully paſſes by, and the ſatisfaction, which the King gave the Parliament, and whole Kingdome vpon his returne out of Spaine, &amp; the diſſolving of thoſe Treaties, which occaſioned that letter muſt ſtopp the mouth of all detractours to offer it as an argument of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> inclination to the Roman Religion?</p>
               <p>The Libeller anſweares his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> argument to prove <hi>his ſufferings out of conſcience, not Policie, becauſe his loſſes were more conſiderable then epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> with objecting <hi>hardning, and blindnes,</hi> being himſelfe hardned to oppoſe all light of truth, and ſhut his eyes againſt the cleereſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where hath more faction, and confuſion ever been bredd, then vnder the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritie of his owne Monarchicall Government.</hi> The king pretended not, any Government could abſolutely ſhut out faction, but we may be ſure thoſe factions are moſt dangerous to all Governments, whoſe principles are deſtructive to it, and theſe factions were not bredd in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Monarchy, but among the Enemies af it, and the envious man ſowed his tares, while men ſlept, and as he will not <hi>ſtand powling of the reformed Churches to know their numbers,</hi> ſoe he wil hand over head affirme, that the farr greater part in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> three kingdomes deſired what <hi>they have now done to throw downe Epiſcopacie,</hi> which hath as litle weight
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95058:121"/>as truth. the reformed Churches are not vilified one by another, though each maintaine their ſeverall formes of Government, and his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> is farr from vilifying thoſe Churches, but the Libeller vilifies himſelfe, and them that ſcoffs at their Arch preſbitery claſſicall, and Dioceſine Preſbitery, and their Prieſt-led herodians, blinde guides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>None but Lutherans retained Biſhopps,</hi> and therein convinces himſelfe of his often repeated vntruths, that all the reformed Churches rejected Epiſcopacy for the Novations, Montaniſts having noe other Biſhopps, then ſuch, as were in every village is another of his falſities in adding the word every, and it doth not prove, that theſe heretickes had not Biſhopps, and Preſbiters, which Chriſtians may have, though they live in Caves, and deſerts, and its evident in ſtory thoſe heretickes had Biſhopps. That the Aerians were condemned for heretickes the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beler well knowes, and the King naming them ſoe meddles not with their particular hereſies, and it is too obſcure to be ſeene, that the King faſtens that opinion touching Biſhopps, and Preſbiters for their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. Though the Clergie ought to miniſter the goſpell, if the people ſupply them not, yet ſuch temutie, and contempt quickely becomes a Carkaſe indeede. The Sectaries, that place their greatenes in being the ringleaders of faction turne all Religion into a fantaſme, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing they could never by any judicious choiſe obtaine preferment in the Church profeſſe the diſlike of them, and ſeeke their fortunes in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the multitude.</p>
               <p>Its eaſily beleived, that <hi>wealth may breede vices</hi> in the Clergie, as well, as others, but muſt they therefore be made poore, and others rich by the robbery of them? the Kings choiſe of Biſhopps will convince the clamours of the Schiſmatickes, and gives juſt cauſe to expect the evill conſequences the King foretells of their removall. That the function of Biſhopps, and Preſbiters was not tyed to place, though the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it was by Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution, he hath been already told, and that it was neceſſary the Apoſtolique power for the Government of the Church muſt deſcend to Biſhopps, there being noe others, that ever pretended to it.</p>
               <p>How <hi>the Church floriſht vnder Epiſcopacie,</hi> the extent of the Chriſtian Religion over ſoe greate a part of the world doth ſufficiently teſtifie, &amp; the <hi>corruption</hi> of many in that <hi>order</hi> doth not take away the benifitt of it, which acrewed vnto the Church by the labours of others, and all ages have recorded perſons of greate learning, and holines of life in that order.</p>

                  <hi>The Engliſh were called Rebells during the Treatie.</hi> And why not? till the Treatie had made an abolition of their offence, for did they forbeare any of their reproachfull termes, or Rebellious actions againſt the king, and his partie during the Treatie?</p>

But whence is this collection of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velliſh fraude by a divelliſh interpreter? If the King thought not the appellation due to them, which he gave them, doth it follow, that he muſt eſteeme himſelfe abſolved of performance of his promiſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Theſe are dreames from divelliſh infuſions, not reaſonable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, the titles of treating parties having noe influence vpon the performance of the things promiſed, and they of the other ſide might have ſaid, they were abſolved from performance, becauſe they treated with the Kings Commiſſioners vnder other Titles then they had, or were knowne by, but they would perſwade the people, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſafe vnleſſe the maſter Rebells rule.</p>

                  <hi>IT is noe new, or vnwonted thing for bad men to claime as much part in God, as his beſt Servants.</hi> And all men looke vpon the Rebells in England, as the vnparalleld prodigies of this hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, their claimes vnto Gods ſervice, and favour, the vſurpation of thoſe appellations, that belong to the Godly, their oſtentations of faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, prayers, and thankesgivings, and ſevere cenſures of the perſons, and manners of others, are a ſufficient demonſtration of this preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men hardned in wickednes, and reſolved to proſecute ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſignes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He is yet to learne what good vſe the King made of theſe various events,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he acknowledge, though he ſee the vſe of inſolence, &amp; cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which the Rebells have made of their ſucceſſes againſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe numbers, which the King grew to from ſmall beginnings, came not out of love, but fled to be protected from the feare of reformation.</hi> A jolly conceite, what feare of reformation was there, or appeares yet? It was neceſſary dutie to oppoſe Rebells, and confuſion, and that was then knowne vnto the ſillieſt people, but ſuch, as were poyſened by the contagious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Rebellious Sectaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such a ſnow ball might eaſily gather through thoſe cold, and darke provinces of ignorance, and lewdeneſſe.</hi> And can he thinke, that any Provinces are ſoe ignorant, and lewde, as theſe ſinkes, and Kenells, whence the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells raked the rabble of raſcallitie, which they armed againſt the king? The libeller could not be ignorant of what al his partie acknowledge, the greate diſproportion in qualitie both for place, and education, that was in the Kings partie above their owne.</p>
               <p>The Libeller would have <hi>Gods long ſuffering ſometimes to harden, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95058:124"/>be the beginning of a ſeverer puniſhment.</hi> But he over lookes that ſenſible obduration, which ſucceſſes have brought vpon the Rebells, and as they are a ſevere puniſhment vpon the nation, ſoe we may conceive by their wickednes, that their proſperitie bindes them over to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judgment.</p>
               <p>He would convince the King of <hi>breaking lawes, and that he had not the ſword by law, not ſoe much, as to vnſheath againſt a forraigne Enemy.</hi> And by ſoe palpable an vntruth, it being knowne vnto the whole world, that Leagues, and warrs with forraigne nations were made by the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone we may conclude, he hath quitted ſhame, &amp; is reſolved to ſticke to his falſe aſſertions, and <hi>tottering</hi> Arguments, though never ſoe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his owne Judgment, &amp; knowledge, &amp; heere againe he repeates his jaded diſcourſe of a <hi>free nation, body of Parliament, and ſword in a ſingle hand</hi> ſo often ſpurred vp, and downe ſince the beginning of his booke. The libeller, if the would have vſed Arguments ſhould have expreſſed wherein his pretences differ from other Rebells, for all pretend Tyrany in their Rulers, &amp; fighting for libertie, but he will have fighting lawful to make a new Republique, and to take the ſword to deſtroy the old, &amp; inſteede of making the King guiltie of the breach of lawes, juſtifies the Rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe lawes were executed. Whatever he objects for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Rebellion againſt a King is as poſſible to any other Government, for are al Republiques of one Religion, &amp; may the ſubjects of different Religion from what is eſtabliſhed in any ſtate Rebel, &amp; ſay it is vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that rulers muſt be obeyed, when they wil not conforme to the opinions of a ſect, &amp; ſo ſeverall opinions muſt decide their Religion by the ſword. If ſuch Rebells die <hi>Martirs</hi> we have been much deceived of malefactours, and noe Traytours will want a ſaint-ſhipp.</p>
               <p>This opinion of his touching the <hi>holines</hi> of Rebellion, he ſayes, <hi>is not the opinion, but full beleife of farr holyer, and wiſer men, then Paraſiticke prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> For holy, and wiſe men the Libeller ſeemes to be litle acquainted with, and vnles they be the ſcandall of preachers, and baſeſt of Paraſites none can be ſoe vile to maintaine ſuch odious aſſertions. Its well knowne the Crim catching ſermonizers to theſe Rebells have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough to ſpeake what they know not, &amp; men hired to act a falſe part will bluſh at nothing; and therefore, though never King was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Parliament, nor could be, becauſe they depended on him, and were called by him: though Parliaments never acted in law, Civill oaths, nor Religion but by the Kings aſſent, and the oath which he calls the Kings, and hath ſoe often mentioned, was never eſtabliſht by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, yet againſt all evidence this libeller, &amp; his Mates will affirme, that <hi>nothing was thought to be eſtabliſhed, which that houſe declares to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</hi> Its like he meanes the houſe of Commons, which never till theſe blacke times pretended a power to give an oath, much leſſe make a law, and ſuch, as make theſe vaſt vntruths outgoe Paraſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:95058:124"/>preachers, and all knights of the Poſt, that are yet diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It were abſurd to give the Parliament a legiſtative power, and vpbraide them for tranſgreſſing old Eſtabliſhment.</hi> Whoever thought them to have a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power? Is not the King the Legiſlatour, and they his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and is it not abſurd to give the Legiſlative power to them, that are to adviſe the Legiſlatour, and when the two houſes deſire the King, that it may be made a law by the King with their conſent, is it not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, that one houſe ſhould ſay all the Legiſlative power is in them? But there neede noe proofe of their tranſgreſſing old eſtabliſhments, when they confeſſe it. Its like the Rebells thinke their <hi>heaven</hi> heere, and they doe not much value the loſſe of the other, and noe man is troubled with his cenſure, to whome Charitie, and truth are alike deſpicable.</p>
               <p>The Libeller, that ſcoffes at the ſeeking of heaven in <hi>forma pauperis</hi> ſhewes his value of heaven, and ſeekes none but that, which is to be found in forma proditoris. He thinkes to take of the horror of their death, that dyed in willfull perjury, and Rebellion againſt the king by raving againſt the kings partie, <hi>who</hi> he ſayes <hi>died moſt frequently with oaths, and other damning words in their mouths,</hi> And is ſoe impotent to hope, that the Calumnies of a perjured wretch will finde creditt, for were he not diſtempered by helliſh deluſion, or ſottiſhly drunken, he would not ſoe ſtupidly affirme, that it was <hi>notorious, that they, who were hotteſt in his cauſe, the moſt part of them were men oftner drunke, then by their good will ſober,</hi> it being a knowne truth, that men of moſt eminent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie were hotteſt in the kings cauſe, &amp; theis traytours never forbare any wickednes by their will but for their ends. The king neede not a diſcovery to the <hi>ſtate of their conſciences,</hi> more then by their Actions, that fought againſt him, and he might juſtly beleive <hi>they had never the better of him in their owne conſciences, where they were more affraid to encounter thoſe many reaſons from law, alleagiance, and Chriſtian grounds, then in a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bravery to ſight.</hi> And is it to <hi>preſume more then a Pope to ſay this?</hi> But he that will not ſticke at open falſification will not ſticke to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoughts, and offer conjectures for convertions, ſuch as were moſt zealous in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> cauſe had a ſobrietie vnblemiſhable by a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours malice, and were not only free from <hi>druken</hi> diſtemper, but bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh inſolence, and brazen impudence, which the Rebells rather af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then repent of. And is there not a juſt cauſe, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of many <hi>ſhould grow ſuſpitious, and corrected</hi> by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the miſnamed Parliament, now proved falſe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended? Whats become of their making a glorious King, lawes of the land, priviledges of Parliament? Doth not every man ſee they are all in the dirt among the Libellers Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But they never pretended to eſtabliſh his Throne without our Libertie,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:95058:125"/>and Religion, nor Religion without the word of God, nor to judge of lawes by their being eſtabliſhed, but to eſtabliſh them by their being Good, and neceſſary.</hi> They never pretended, that his throne was inconſiſtent with libertie, or Religion, nor to judge of lawes otherwiſe, then by being eſtablished. But who muſt be the <hi>Dictatours,</hi> the Parliament, which is crumbled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a cloſe Committee, and ſtate Counſell, or any rabble, that ſhall ſay this, or that law is not good, and therefore to be repealed, though eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, he ought to have concluded, that they never pretended privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Parliament further then the ſubterranean junto, or the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults ſhould judge neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To pray, and not to governe is for a Monke not a King.</hi> But is prayer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Government? Thoſe men will accuſe the King for being a Chriſtian, and have as litle love to prayer, as obedience, a monke will better governe, then ſuch a man pray, who is conſtant to malice, &amp; falſhood, and this man that ſayes to governe by Parliament juſtifies his Rebellion to take away Kinglie Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His legiſlative Parliament, and oppreſſed lawes</hi> cannot be admitted, where other anſweare is wanting, but the Libeller hath long ſince thruſt the force of them out of doores by his many prevarications, confining them all in the Cabinet of his owne braine, which muſt determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be good, and neceſſary.</p>
               <p>He is conſtant to Iohn of Leidens principles, that muſt take away other mens goods for doubt of ill vſing them, and becauſe the King ſayes, he <hi>feared the temptation of an abſolute Conqueſt,</hi> therefore it was <hi>pious, and friendly in the Parliament to reſiſt him.</hi> Their pietie, and friendſhipp were much alike, and the Libellers Riligion might come in for a ſhare. Its very probable, that this warr had never been, if the Act for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Parliament had not been conſented to by the King, and that Act might ſtopp the mouth of any reaſonable man, from ſaying there was ſuch a power in the two houſes, as the Libeller dreames of, that deſired that Act from the King, and it was never heard in our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that ever <hi>Parliaments</hi> made warr againſt <hi>Kings, as Tyrants,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for how could they make awarr, that neither could, nor ever did prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to ſit longer, then their King pleaſed, &amp; the immodeſtie, &amp; ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the preſent Rebells have farr exceeded the worſt Examples.</p>
               <p>He is obſtinate to his principles, and feares to attribute any thing to the Kings conceſſions, or denyall, and had <hi>he graunted leſſe</hi> in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie himſelfe, and the Kingdome had ſuffred leſſe.</p>
               <p>It cannot be doubted, but the Libeller will invert whatever the King ſayes, and it is a greate adventure, that he ſayes <hi>the ſins of their lives not ſeldome fought againſt them,</hi> and wee have greate cauſe to beleive their proſperitie did noe leſſe, that continue hardned in ſoe execrable a cauſe.</p>
               <p>The King ſayes he deſires not <hi>any man ſhould be further ſubject to him, then all of vs ſhould be ſubject to God.</hi> And this Mountebanke holds this <hi>a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95058:125"/>ſacriledge worſe, then Biſhopps lands,</hi> for he ſayes he deſires <hi>aſmuch ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is due to God, and ſo deſires, noe leſſe then to be a god.</hi> And is ſubjection to Princes in the, Lord ſubjection to them as God? And doth the King deſire otherwiſe, that would have them noe otherwiſe obey him, then that they might obey God, renouncing all obedience, that conſiſts not with obeying God, but ſale worke muſt be ſlight, and the Libeller would not exceede his hire.</p>
               <p>The Rebells deſiring the Kings <hi>acquittall of them for the blood of the warr</hi> confirmes their guilt, not their innocence. Though God impute not to any man the blood ſhedd in a juſt cauſe in reſpect of the ground, and reaſon of doing it, yet there may be temptations vnto naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie in acting a juſt cauſe, and the King was not without a ſenſe of ſuch danger, therefore the Libeller wretchedly beggs an argument of his guilt from his prayer <hi>not to have blood imputed to him.</hi>

Can a Chriſtian breake all the lawes of the ſecond table vpon pretence of keeping the firſt? And did not he, that Commaunded to have noe other Gods, but him, commaund the honour of Father, &amp; Mother? May a private Chriſtian robb, and kill, becauſe perſons are not of his Religion.

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:95058:127"/>contrary to the commaund of God, they may not vſe violence, &amp; force, but theſe are the Phariſees, that teach men by making a vow vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Gods ſervice to diſobey Parents, which our Saviour ſoe much condemnes. Chriſts Kingdome is ſpiritual in the hearts of the faithful, not in <hi>a papall conſiſtory, nor a congregationall pullpitt,</hi> they were beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that obeyed not wicked commaunds, but deteſted by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that vſed violence againſt their Pagan Governours, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches may ſee what Communion can be had with thoſe, that profeſſe thoſe beſt Chriſtians, that were leaſt ſubject to their King.</p>

               <p>THE Publication of the Kings Letters had quite contrary effects to theſe, which the publiſhers intended, and inſteede of diſcovering matter to their advantage, caſt ſhame on their falſe aſperſions, whereby they ſought to withdraw

The endeavours to be aſſiſted with forraigne forces, when ſoe horrid a Rebellion had taken deepe roote was neither againſt any former profeſſions, nor any rules of Juſtice, and pietie, but naming of Papiſts, and forraigne forces were the bugbeares, wherewith the faction affrighted the ſilly people, and vnder pretence of revenging the blood of Ireland, ſought to draw men inclinable to aſſiſt the King, or vnwilling to fight againſt him into that imployment, that he might be more expoſed to their power, and they might have the better meanes to weaken him, and ſupport their owne Rebellion. Theſe Letters have diſcovered their groſſe impoſtures in repreſenting the King wholy Governed by the Queene, or others, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing cleerely, that his owne judgment cheifely ſteered his owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and its like the faction long ſince ſaw their owne raſhnes in that Publication, and that the world tooke notice, that they were ſoe farr from doubting the Kings affection to Popery, that their deſigne was cheifely to declare his averſenes to it, that they might prevent his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours from Princes of that Religion.</p>

And <hi>honour, and Civilitie</hi> being taken, as he would have it for <hi>diſcretion, honeſtie, prudence, and plaine truth,</hi> the publiſhers of theſe Letters not only ſtand guiltie of the breach of thoſe vertues, but appeare the venemous, and vnnaturall Traytours to mankinde.</p>
               <p>To cover this baſe Act the Libeller ſayes, that ſuch courſes are <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with none more then Kings,</hi> and produces, and Example out of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> relating the diſcovery of a Latter by <hi>Lewes the eleventh</hi> written to him from the <hi>Dutcheſſe of Burgundy,</hi> which he ſayes <hi>the Hiſtorian doth not charge with incivilitie, or diſhonour.</hi> And is that the caſe of publiſhing Letters, that paſſed betweene man, and wife, and may ſubjects doe to their King, what Enemies may one to another? The Libeller will ſay yes, for he holds noe ſubordination, though the publiſhers profeſſed the contrary, and would not be thought to have abjured their Allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, or that they tooke their King for their Enemy, but their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices were noe more conſiſtent, then the Libellers Arguments,</p>
               <p>The injury offred to the <hi>Kings Mother</hi> was too well knowne to be a <hi>fained ſuſpition or jealoſie in him,</hi> and if they had not been guiltie of that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95058:128"/>baſe aſperſion, they would have acquitted themſelves ſome other way, then by the publication, and frequent repetition. The Libeller appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res to glory more in recitall of it, then in the argument, which he can draw from pretence of faining a ſuſpition, and he, that ſuckes any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations vpon the King out of thoſe letters muſt be a Beetle, not a Bee, and they, that from placing conſtancy to his wife, before the mention of Religion, and law will ſpin a <hi>webb</hi> of determination for the prioritie of affection, have more of the <hi>ſpiders</hi> venom, then the Bees ſweetenes.</p>
               <p>They which eſteemed their King, though one man the breath of their noſtrills, thought the nation could not be happy without him, And the late Parliament, whereon the Libeller buildes his faith affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their declarations, <hi>the happines of the Kingdome did ſoe mainely depend on his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> and the Royall branches of that roote, as in an ordinary way of providence, they would not except it from any other fountaine, or ſtreame.</hi> And are they therefore a nation of Ideots, and miſerable, as he ſayes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>To make reconciliation deſperate,</hi> the Libeller holds reaſonable, and aſkes, <hi>why they ſhould feare it,</hi> and ſuch, as intend not reconciliation with God, thinke they have noe neede to be reconciled to men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their fact is not parallell to Chams revealing his fathers nakednes, for the King at that time could not be eſteemed the father of his Countrey, nor had ever merited that Title.</hi> And might not Cham have ſaid ſoe to his father, aſwell, as doe what he did? But they, who acknowledged that Title due to him, as the Parliament did, and gave it him as their King, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excuſe themſelves from a ſin parallell to Chams, nor from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this curſe.</p>
               <p>The Libeller profeſſes averſenes to all reconciliation vpon pretence

               <p>The ſcotts needed not armies to <hi>defend their libertie, &amp; conſciences,</hi> which were never invaded, &amp; the charges were not out of charity to them, but for the neceſſitie of thoſe, who ſent for the ſcotch aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he il prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds a cauſe for the ſcotts <hi>miſtruſt</hi> of the king in that caſe, where a ground of ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could not be imagined, &amp; judges others by his own obduratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

               <p>The man thinkes much, that their <hi>profeſt loyaltie,</hi> who fought againſt their King ſhould be called a <hi>riddle,</hi> and as it was a very darke one to generall vnderſtanding, ſoe if they had preſerved the Kings perſon being in their power, they had given ſome ſolution doing what they ſaid of their loyaltie, not what their former Actions imported.

               <p>
                  <hi>The words of a King are full of power by the law,</hi> and that law is not like the <hi>Nazarites locke of ſampſon,</hi> but an anointing they have from God, which is inſeperable, though Rebells like the faithles harlot cut of his force, and Armies, yet the right of his power is inſeperable, and if theſe Traytours had looked to precept, or Example, they might have found, that a Kings word had power, and their perſons reverence without reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the merit of their Actions.

                  <hi>The prayers made by the forenamed Kings in the Temple, and by the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95058:131"/>Apoſtles, and ancient Chriſtians for above three hundred yeares were in vaine, if the heart cannot ſafely joyne with another mans extemporall ſufficiency.</hi> And whence doth it appeare, that any of theſe prayers, that were made for others to joyne in, were made vpon extemporall ſufficiency, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appeares, when the Scripture expreſſely dictates the words, which the Prieſt ſhall vſe, whereto the people muſt ſay Amen, &amp; there is not any ſtory, from whence the want of Leiturgies in the firſt age of the Church can be collected, but there are Teſtimonies of their antiquitie, aswell, as neceſſitie of their vſe. Its a ſigne of a prophane heart, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes his mirth, of <hi>divinitie,</hi> and a very litle witt goes to the conceites of a <hi>cloſett Chapplaine, and a minde wandring after preferment, or his dinner in the time of prayer.</hi> Doubtles he eſteemes a dinner more, then devotion, that places the ſumme of his Religion in affected, and ſcorneful ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of other mens intentions.</p>
               <p>He aſkes, <hi>what avayles their praying with him.</hi> And why ſhould men joyne in prayer at all, is there noe efficacie in ſuch conjuncture? We may not doubt both of aſſiſtance in our prayers, and bleſſing vpon them by joyning with our ſpirituall Fathers in that dutie, and he, that hath moſt <hi>oyle in his owne lampe,</hi> will ſeeke encreaſe of it by thoſe diſpenſers, which God hath appointed.</p>
               <p>The libellers objections are not like <hi>thoſe apples of Aſphaltis,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he compares the Kings diſcourſes, but like thoſe foggs, and Miſts, which ariſe out of a putrified matter, and are offenſive to the eyes, whome they would hinder from beholding the ſun, and are inſtantly diſpelled with the ſame heate, that moved them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many things were ſung in the Kings Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that were not vnderſtood.</hi> It may be by ſome men, that would not, but ſuch, as could vnderſtand what was read, might vnderſtand what was ſung in the Kings Chappell, there being neither ſtrange language, nor note to make any thing vnintelligible.</p>
               <p>His beleife is, that <hi>God is noe more moved with a prayer elaborately pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then men truly Charitable with the penned ſpeech of a beggar.</hi> There is no doubt of it, if there want devotion in him, that vſes it, but what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is there betweene a prayer elaborately penned, and haflily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, is God more moved with extemporall, then elaborate expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and are not the tunes of their new Levites too neere the ſound of Common beggars to be eſteemed a fruite of devotion by the hearers?</p>

The King expreſſes his Fatherly pitty to his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſubjects, and the Libeller his emptines of defence in aſſuming ſoe impertinent an inference, as if David could not acknowledge Gods Juſtice in the Rebellion of Abſolom without the acknowledgment of his wicked Sons righteouſnes, nor the King vſe Davids confeſſion of Gods Juſtice vpon occaſion of the preſent puniſhment of the people by the ſword, and his proofe is ſuteable to his collection, for he ſayes <hi>in the next line, he accuſes the Church it ſelfe for the Churches Enemy.</hi> The next line is, <hi>let my ſuffrings ſatiate the malice of mine, and the Churches Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> ſure the man would have his independent brethren the only true Church, that are the Enemies of it, their victories are by <hi>Miracle,</hi> and what then are the Turkes, which were greater, and more ſtrange then theirs?

               <p>The Libeller will not endure any glory to be given to God, but by the <hi>medly</hi> Sectaries, nor any <hi>reſtitution of the King, to his cheife Cittie,</hi> but with the ſpilling of his blood, and thoſe that were faithfull to him.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:95058:132"/>that would betray it to Pagans, by obtruding ſuch doctrines, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for Chriſtian, which may make it odious to morall heathens, who could only heeretofore queſtion the truth of our beleife, but may by theis new reformers take occaſion to accuſe our Religion of impietie, for theſe wretches repreſent it contrary to all the principles of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon honeſtie. The Rebells cannot beleive a pardon, they-know their demeritts ſoe execrable, and therefore he will ſuppoſe the King would finde meanes to puniſh, though he promiſed pardon.

               <p>The Libeller is a good witnes againſt himſelfe, ſaying <hi>to counterfeite the hand of God is the boldeſt of all forgeries, and he, who without warrant, but his owne fantaſtique ſurmiſe takes vpon him perpetually to vnfold the ſecret, and vnſearchable miſterie of high providence, it likely for the moſt part to miſtake, and ſlander them, and approaches to the madnes of thoſe reprobate thoughts, that would wreſt the ſword of Iuſtice out of Gods owne hand, and apply it more juſtly in his conceite,</hi> and himſelfe makes the application, that vſurpes

Though Tumults might be the firſt occaſion, yet this was not the whole occaſion, for theſe Tumults were ſeconded by ſeizing the forts, and Navy, &amp; rayſing an Army by thoſe, that rayſed the Tumults, and their guilt in rayſing Tumults, ſought protection from a formed, Army, and this Method of divine Juſtice, ſober men obſerve with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, while irrationall, and obſtinate Traytours attribute nothing, but their owne ſucceſſes to the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God in favour, which is in wrath to themſelves, and others.</p>

                  <hi>It is not the place, but the end, and cauſe, that makes a Parliament.</hi> And then all they, that ſay they have a good cauſe, and a good end are a Parliament, and what neede is there then of a writ, or Elections? And Tumults are as good, as Parliaments, and the end, and the cauſe make them Tumults, and noe Tumults, Parliament and noe Parliament, and an Aſſembly at the beare garden is as good, as the houſe of Commons, he hath found the event to ſalve all, for <hi>they returned ſoone to their places,</hi> that fled from theſe latter Tumults, and that is the finall deciſion of all controverſie.</p>

Is not the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers mentioning the ſeditious tongues of his falſe preachers more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, then the naming of the German Biſhopp?

The Triumphs of Rebells are vnnaturall Prodigies, and the dances of devills. The pittie of innocent Martirs, which they expreſſed for proud perſecutours was lookt on, as the Kings by theſe villaines, and the wicked Jewes deſpiſed our ſaviours bidding them not weepe for him, but for themſelves, and for their Children. Although the Libeller ſoe lately juſtified chaſtning of the Parliament, yet he will have it an injury in the King to perſwade men againſt the Parliament, and ſoe he ties the end, and the cauſe to what he pleaſes, and as long, as he can bring noe better evidence, then the ſucceſſe of vſurpation, he waſhes not of any guilt from himſelfe, nor his rowte.</p>

By our happines he intends doubtles his Rebell partie, whoſe happines is to raigne, and Tyranize over the people, and that cannot continue with reinſtalling the King. But the people of England expect not any end of their miſerie, but by reſtoring the juſt rights of their lawfull King, and they now deſcerne, that the ſucceſſe of a wicked cauſe was a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God vpon the nation, whoſe vnthankefullnes, for their long proſperitie had juſtly provoked his wrath.</p>
               <p>He goes on to his proofes, that <hi>the king beares wittnes in his owne words, that the corrupt education of his youth was not vntruly charged vpon him, or his Sonne,</hi> and that he gathers from theſe words of the Kings, <hi>Court delights are prone either to roote vp all true vertue, and honour, or to be contented only with ſome leaves, and withering formalities of them without any reall fruites tending to the publique good.</hi> And is it a proofe, that becauſe Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are prone to produce ſuch fruites therefore all, that live in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Courts muſt neceſſarily have a corrupt education, &amp; might not this Libeller have cleerely obſerved, that his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> was free from ſuch a corrupt education, that had ſoe cleere a ſight of the ill conſequences of Court delights. Though there be theſe pleaſures at the Court, it is not the education of Princes, whoſe youth is ſeaſoned by inſtruction againſt the corruption of theſe baites. There are dangers to mens manners from abundance, and high places, and thence the Libeller would inferr, that there muſt neither be wealth, nor power, but in the hands of his Phariſaicall Sectaries, who never complaine of ſuch corruption. The deſperate hipocriſie of theſe traytours is laid ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their owne words, and Actions, and the Libeller from the Kings caution to his Sonne by the example of Rehoboam frames an expreſſion, as if the King affirmed

The beſt Governments are ſubject to repinings, and the greate proſperietie of Solomons Raigne, when ſilver for the plentie was not eſteemed, drew after it popular Complaints of heavy burdens, and whatever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam threatned, Jeroboam really performed, the madnes of the people finding all wayes their murmurings repayed with greater ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. The diſobedience, and contempt of juſt authoritie, and of thoſe principles of Government and Religion, which the King teaches his Son have been the occaſion of al our miſeries, there being nothing like miſerie, or ſuffring before this horrid Rebellion.</p>
               <p>And now the Libeller will have <hi>the breeding op of his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the rugged, and boyſterous licence of vndiſciplined Camps, and garriſons noe better, then the effeminacies of the Court,</hi> and yet he will perſwade vs, that Rebells nurſed vp in that boyſterous, and vnnaturall diſobedience are fitteſt inſtruments of our happines. Thoſe principles, which the King had learnt in his education, and which endured the Tryall of a fierie adverſitie are received for ſound by all ſuch, as have not renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced reverence to Religion. Thoſe principles, which the proſecution of a bloody Rebellion, and the continuall exerciſe of rapine, falſhood, &amp; oppreſſion, have fixed in the hearts of Rebells muſt neceſſarily make the words of the wiſe, &amp; the wayes of the inſt matter only of contempt, and deriſion, and ſuch, as have once broken the bounds of modeſtie, thinke it diſhonour to have ſhame, and repentance, and will advance their confuſions inſteede of order, their Blaſphemies for zeale, their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge for reformation, their Tyrany for law, and all the hell they feare is the loſſe of their vſurped power, and the reſtoring of juſt right, and their jealoſies of looſing their owne greatenes provokes them ſtill to an increaſe of their lewdenes, making truth, and right the object of their ſpite, and perſecution. Theſe debaucht Rebells proclaime, that there is noe good but Rebellion, noe worke of God; but ſubmiſſion to it, and repentance for oppoſing it.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Church of England be Antipapall,</hi> how comes it to bo a <hi>ſchiſme?</hi> And why hath the libeller ſo continually made vp his diſcourſes with
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95058:135"/>inclinations to Popery? Independencie knowes noe ſchiſme, for if it allow every meeting its libertie, where is the ſchiſme?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Its a Rule, that noe Scripture, nor ancient Creede bindes our faith to any Church denominated by a particular name.</hi> But he rejects, what was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the vniverſall Church. What doth that contradict the Kings advice to his Son of his eſteeme of the Church of England, if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, as he did vpon good ground, that it was agreeable in doctrine to the word of God? It is apparent, that theſe Sectaries are ſeperated from all Churches of the world, and that Government, which they call Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique had neither precept, nor practice in any Church, being newly crept out of hell to perſecute the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Noe man was ever bid to be ſubject to the Church of Cornith, Rome, or Aſia, but to the Church without addition.</hi> And why doth he deny to be ſubject to the Church without addition, was there never Church before this day? heere we have the builders of Babell, none vnderſtand what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayes, were not thoſe that lived in thoſe Churches of Corinth, Rome, &amp; Aſia commaunded to be ſubject to the Governours of thoſe Churches? Is it not the Apoſtles Commaund to obey thoſe, that have the overſight of them, and may every man deſpiſe their new indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent congregations, &amp; ſeeke for a Church without addition, and where then will he finde him? We may imagine what manner of ſtate ſuch Church reformers will erect, and what it is they call reformation, that looke vpon all Churches, as ſchiſmes, becauſe not rent into as many parts, as particular perſons. Theſe ſchismatickes pretend the Church of England <hi>allmoſt growne Popiſh,</hi> and yet nothing altered from the firſt reformation, &amp; while they diſguiſe their meaning by pretending pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to gett the vulgar vnawares to favour their diſſembled zeale, they demaund to have the Reformation <hi>vneſtabliſhed.</hi> And the reſtraint of their Rebellion is <hi>Pharaohs prohibition</hi> to the Iſraelites, that ſought leave toſacrifiſe to God. It was a greate teſtimony of the Kings zeale to the Church of God, that he forewarned his Sonne to ſuppreſſe errours, &amp; ſchiſmes, his owne experience having taught him, that theſe doggs, and evill workers are the greateſt evills to Church, and ſtate, and theſe deſtroyers, that are the reproaches of Religion, the Scabbs, and biles to be Church, allow noe proteſtant Churches to be communicated with, that are not tainted with the ſame putrifaction, that hath corrupted them.</p>
               <p>For the Civill ſtate the kings precepts tend to the preſervation of Civill libertie, and it was farr from our <hi>Fathers</hi> to thinke, that any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes were <hi>immutable,</hi> but further, that lawes ſhould be altered at the will of a mutable multitude, and that their King ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the judgment of the reaſons for a change. He falls from the queſtion touchinge repeale of lawes, and talkes of ſaving the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, we may better truſt the King with ſaving the Kingdome, then
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95058:136"/>any number of men we can picke out, whoſe private fortunes may be ſaved, though the kingdome be loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Turkes, Iawes, and Moores enjoy vnder the Turkiſh Government, what their induſtrie, and labour have made their owne.</hi> If that be true the Libeller is much out of the way to thinke it a reproach to Civill Government to compare it to the Turkes; what Civill libertie doth the freeſt nation claime more, and what doe theſe Maſters of the new Republique pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to allow more? Doe they not plainely tell the people, they ought to have noe more, then they will give them? Thus he will defend the Turke, Jew, and Moore rather then be an Engliſhman.</p>
               <p>There is noe doubt, but the libertie of the ſubject depends <hi>on the Regall power in the firſt place.</hi> There is noe libertie without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and where the Government is regall, the ſubject muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, or be a Traytour, and give vp his libertie for a prey to rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous vſurpers.</p>
               <p>That <hi>the King ſuffred it to be preached in his owne hearing, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject had noe propertie of his goods, but all was the Kings right.</hi> Is a mainfeſt vntruth, yet they, which make advantage of ſuch inventions practiſe what they reproach, for doth not that thing they call a Parliament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a few contemptible perſons profeſſe, that all the goods of the ſubjects are at their diſpoſing. By the lawes of England noe act can be a law without the king, though both houſes propounded it, and in that negative voyce of the kings, the people repoſed their libertie, which they would not wholly intruſt to a Major part of one, or both houſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The power of the whole nation is vertually in the Parliament.</hi> But there is noe vertue in it without the king. And is it vertually in ſuch a part of the Parliament, as either the Army, or the Tumults ſhall picke out? The Libeller hath borne wittnes for the kings Martirdome, though he intended the contrary, and while he names the Rebells war in their owne defence, cannot avoyde to tell the world, the Rebellion was to take away the Kings negative voyce, and eſtabliſh lawes at their owne will. Every man will beare wittnes, that it is Martirdome to die, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then burne incenſe to Idolls, or Devills, and he that refuſes to introduce ſchiſme, and diſorder into the Church, and committ ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious pillage of Church goods, and is perſecuted to death for his refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, is noe leſſe a Martir, then he, that ſuffers for denying an Idolatrous worſhipp, and this is not to die for Religion, becauſe eſtabliſht, but that eſtabliſhment, which we ought to preſerve, and all the painting, &amp; dawbing of theſe Artiſans of Rebellion will not deface that Martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which their owne wicked hands have teſtified. There are no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, that have aboliſht the Decalogue, &amp; ſo long a king, that dies by a wicked Rebellion for not conſenting to Trayterours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds is judged a Martir by the <hi>beſt reformed Churches,</hi> but he does not
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:95058:136"/>looke before he leape, that brings in the <hi>Romiſh Prieſts executed for that, which had been eſtabliſhed,</hi> for he might have knowne they were executed by lawes in force, and for doing what noe law in force allowed, and there is a great deale of difference betweene heretickes dying for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours againſt vniverſall truths, and Martirs dying for vniverſally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved truths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The legiſlative Parliament, and law of Coronation, and obſtinacie of one man</hi> his ſoe often chewed Rhetorique will not aide him to overcome ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent truth, and noe <hi>Parliament</hi> could have been ſoe <hi>ridiculous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible</hi> a thing, as they, which abuſe the name have now made it, ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it too, and fro like a footeball at the will of the multitude, and noe men are more <hi>markes for ſlaves,</hi> then ſuch, as are deſtined to ſuch a vaſſallage vnder ſuch Maſters.</p>
               <p>Noe tolleration can pleaſe ſchiſmatickes, that is bounded with any lawes, and vnles they have a libertie to treade downe all law, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they account it not freedome, and ſuch tolleration, which other Churches account themſelves happy in, theſe Sectaries account deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, that will have it not beneath the honour of a Parliament, and free nation to receive a Schiſmaticall pretended Religion, deviſed by a junto of Mechannickes.</p>
               <p>His <hi>ſuſpitions of palliation</hi> are of the ſame ſtuffe with his poſitions, and we may well thinke vpon his owne grounds, that the Kings advice to his Son <hi>to be tender of the people,</hi> was ſincere, <hi>whoſe deſtruction would be his vndoing.</hi> Which might juſtly move a Prince to that tendernes. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull Rebells are noe leſſe infamous, then greate, and theſe, who place the hopes of immortall prayſe in the exceſſe of villanies, only erect the Monuments of their impieties the higher, that they may be ſeene by poſteritie, though they avoyded for the preſent the heigth of Hamans Gallowes, and we may not thinke ſuch men looke to be remembred in mercy with God, who ſhewed none to men. They thinke with Cain their ſin greater, then can be forgiven.</p>
               <p>Although the King Exhort his Son <hi>not to ſtudy revenge,</hi> yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, that <hi>he, or at leaſt they about him intend not to follow that exhortation,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> he ſayes <hi>was ſeene lately at the Hague.</hi> Its like he intends, the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Doriſtans their Rebell Agent. Is that an Argument of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying revenge after Reconciliation, that a profeſt villaine was ſtaine in the heate of indignation, comming in Triumph with the blood of the Murthred King, as his Trophey? The Libeller would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwade the multitude, that it concernes them aſmuch, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e impious projectours of Rebellion to feare ſuch revenge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may not repent, but like himſelfe maintaine Treaſon to be the better cauſe, and to returne to loyaltie were <hi>ficklenes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabilitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He cannot endure the Government by Biſhopps, for he ſayes, <hi>it is
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:95058:137"/>away to ſubdue the conſciences of vulgar men to ſlaviſh doctrine.</hi> The doctrine he meanes is order, an obedience, and he would have a compendious way to ſchiſme, and Rebellion, and thats the grudge, which Traytours have at this Government, and their profeſt quarrell.</p>
               <p>He will not admit, that <hi>Parliaments can have freedome, if the King may deny any thing, which a Major part propounds,</hi> as if they had noe freedome, vnles the prevailing partie were abſolute Lords, and yet their freedome is preſerved, though the Army picke out a few to be the Parliament, and ſend packing the reſt, and this is the foundation of the Engliſh freedome, as he would have it, and that this Conventicle muſt have the name of Parliament, and not of a faction. The concluſion, that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller would have is, that the Parliament ſhould conſiſt of a few Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous deſigners, to whoſe voyce the reſt muſt be only an <hi>Eecho,</hi> and the found of a Parliament muſt be noe other, then a bagpipe, yeilding only ſuch noates, as the breath, and ſtopps of the prime Maſters allow it. We have ſeene thoſe <hi>tapiſtry Parliaments,</hi> which he mentions, which ſtay, and remove at the pleaſure of thoſe Maſters of the houſhould; And ſhould not the King have a power to ſtopp the extravagant motions of theſe impetuous Commaunders, which blaſted all ſuch, whoſe wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and gravitie offred wholeſome Counſells for publique ſafetie, and ordered their <hi>mutes,</hi> and <hi>noughts</hi> to ſignifie their pleaſure The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome would be ſure of miſerie, as often, as they ſee a Parliament, and the people ſee they muſt ſeeke their preſervation in vnitie, which is Reſident in the head, not in thoſe broken fractions the ſubject of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſuch, as ſeeke <hi>vents, and ouletts</hi> from the ſupreame Government are the whirle windes of miſery, and confuſion, but Traytours would have lawes as eaſily broken, as the ſpiders webb. And this Parliament, to which the King muſt be ſubject, himſelfe will allow noe more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then to ſit in the <hi>nooſe</hi> of their Military generall, which when he pleaſes to <hi>draw to geather with one twitch,</hi> not only with his negative, but poſitive Command, ſhall <hi>throtile the whole nation to the wiſh of Caligula in one necke,</hi> and this the Kings negative was farr from, and if the Libeller ſtitch togeather all the quibbles of paſquills, &amp; ſatirs, they will agree vnto his Rebell Maſters, but loſe their propertie by his application to lawfull Government. Where they have placed the <hi>Militia</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome now feele, who vnderſtood not the word, when they were at firſt hoodminckt by it to ſeeke they knew not what.</p>
               <p>The <hi>deliverance,</hi> which theſe men boaſt of is the deprivation of juſt Government, and the ſubſtitution of lawles will, and the people ſee, that they are foe farr from a <hi>deliverance</hi> that they are delivered over to a languiſhing miſerie vnder the ſharpeſt ſervitude, and they now finde their Idolizing a Parliament hath drawne them from their loyaltie to him, whome God had ſet over them, and caſt them vnder the hard bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of theſe Maſters, and like them, which rejected the ſonns of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95058:137"/>and tooke the ſonne of his ſervant to raigne over them, they feele a fire of diviſion kindled among them to devoure one another.</p>
               <p>This Libeller allowes not any thoughts of revenge in his <abbr>Majeſt</abbr> now living for the murder of his father, and yet reproacheth him for making <hi>peace with the Iriſh,</hi> and not ſeeking their totall extirpation, and the peace with them he calls <hi>a ſordid, diſhonourable, and irreligious ſeeking of his Crowne.</hi> But the man is vnwilling he ſhould have any wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>yes at al, and would perſwade his Sectaries, for none els will beleive him, that the King may not make peace with a Rebell ſubmitting to oppoſe a Rebell perſevering.</p>
               <p>That <hi>the Preſbiter Scott, which woes the King now living is put of</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes from his termes, not from his qualitië. Should not the people of England ſeeke the reſtitution of their King, and legall Government, whereof they have been cheated with the adulterate oſtentations of libertie, and redreſſe of greivances, they would appeare arrant beaſts, that cryed out, and below'd by the inſtinct of their drivers, fighting <hi>like brutes,</hi> till they ran into the <hi>pinfold,</hi> where they are reſerved for ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and ſlaughter by thoſe Maſters, who allured them with foode to put the yoake on their neckes.</p>
               <p>The Libeller diſlikes the kings concluſion, that <hi>Religion to God, and loyaltie to the King cannot be parted without the ſinne, &amp; infelicitie of a people</hi> And ſayes <hi>its contrary to the teaching of Chriſt, that noe man can ſerve two Maſters.</hi> Theſe are fit Judges of our dutie to God, or man, and fit refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of Church, and ſtate, that will have the ſervice of a Maſter, or obedience to a father the ſerving of another Maſter, then God, and the ſpirit of God ſpeaking by St. Peter, feare God, and honour the King muſt contradict the teaching of Chriſt, ſuch Church makers doe we now live with. Such as ſerved heathen Maſters, may not leave their ſervice, though they ſerve not their heathen Gods at their Commaund, and if they did deſert their earthly Maſters for that reaſon, they did not ſerve their Maſter in heaven, who will be ſerved by their ſubjection to their earthly Maſters, but he that will ſerve himſelfe cannot ſerve God, and that ſelfe ſervice is the whole worke of theſe Rebells, who pretend to put God in the firſt place, that they may leave him noe place, and ſuch, as deſert their King vpon pretence of Gods ſervice, deſert God to ſerve themſelves, and they will only enjoy their power, and wealth, and eaſe for Gods ſake, but ſuffer for him they will not, that kinde of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the truth of Religion, they account among the corruptions of the firſt ages of the Church, and they have found a more accurate, and pleaſant way to ſerve God.</p>

From this Lunaticke diſcourſe of the ſtrength of Juſtice, he concludes. <hi>That if by ſentence thus written, it were my happines to ſet free the mindes of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from longing to returne poorely vnder that Captivitie of Kings, from which the ſtrength, and ſupreame ſword of Iuſtice hath delivered them, I ſhall have done a worke, not much inferious to that of Zorobabell.</hi> The ſentence of this braine ſicke Libeller is very weake to worke on any opinion, but the hath ſet free ſome Engliſhmen from the Captivitie of a received errour, for they were made beleive they fought for their King, and this man tells them it was to ſhake of Kings, and ſurely his vainities, and deceites, and his Maſters Tyrany will perſwade the Engliſhmen to ſeeke their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnder the free, and glorious Government of Kings from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie of theis Tyrants, &amp; vſurpers, that have enſlaved them; And that horrid murder of the King vnder the ſhameleſſe pretence of juſtice, muſt neceſſarily worke deteſtation of the fact, and a longing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Dominion of ſuch Monſters. Noe doubt this Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler would thinke it an happines to be ſecure in his ſtolen power, but he muſt expreſſe more reaſon, and leſſe impietie to effect ſuch a worke, &amp; he may be aſſured, that as long, as there are men ſoe ingenuous to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Juſtice, that they muſt deteſt his cauſe, and him. And though Kings be <hi>vnaccountable</hi> to men for their Actions, it is noe way <hi>contrary to the wiſedome of Zorobabell,</hi> who names not Juſtice, and if he had given that ſtrength to Juſtice, which he did to truth, it had been in the ſame ſenſe, vnderſtanding the force of Juſtice, as of other vertues. The ſtrength of the King is over the perſons, that of truth, and Juſtice over the minde. But if the King be accountable to men, are not they, to whome he is accountable by the libellers Argument not only ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the King, but ſtronger then Juſtice? And ſoe Juſtice is not ſtrongeſt, vnles the ſword be putt into a madd mans hand, and the gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy multitude, from whome nothinge, but Injuſtice can be expected may puniſh their Rulers. To what end were Governments ordained, if juſtice be only in the Governed? Were ever like Tyranies, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtices
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95058:139"/>committed by ſingle Rulers, as by the vnbridled multitude, and yet juſtice muſt have noe ſtrength in the mouth of a King, and the word of Rebells only muſt be the ſtrength of juſtice, and this Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, that bindes juſtice to Rebell power, and excludes it from Kings, hopes to be a Zorobabell to the Engliſhmen for his wiſe ſentence.</p>

                  <hi>That noe law of God, or man gives the ſubjects any power of Iudicature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or againſt the King,</hi> he will prove moſt vntrue, and by that <hi>moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and vniverſall law, he that ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhedd, and heere</hi> he ſayes <hi>is noe exception of a King.</hi> Though it be plaine, that he, to whome the power of ſhedding the blod of the offender, is committed, muſt neceſſarily be excepted, vnles they will ſuppoſe he muſt kill himſelfe, doth the Libeller imagine, that by this law, all men were judges, or that the ſubject may judge the ſoveraigne, who is not permitted by any law to judge an Equall? As the divine law appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted puniſhments, ſoe likewiſe Rulers, and if people may judge their Rulers, it anulls all the Commaunds of obedience to ſuperiours, all ſubordination in humane ſocietie, and all deciſion of Controverſie, while every one may pretend his owne opinion the Rule of juſtice.</p>
               <p>Next he hath found the place in numbers. <hi>Ye ſhall take noe ſatisfaction for the life of a Murderer.</hi> But judges, to whome the law was given, were appointed to declare, who was guiltie of Murder, and we may eaſily ſee, who had beene the Murderers, if every man were to judge a ſuperiour, or the multitude their Rulers, and this the Libeller might have found in the ſame booke where the people charge Moſes, and Aron with killing the people of the Lord, and Moſes ſayes, they were ready to ſtone him. And the Libeller may with his Anabaptiſticall brethren vpon better grounds aboliſh Magniſtracie, then make every man a Magiſtrate, as by this reaſon he would. Though the law appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted noe ſatisfaction for the life of a murderer, yet we finde David par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the murder of his ſon Abſolom, and Civill puniſhments are not of immutable law, and it had been murder to take away his life, whome the king had pardoned, and we finde, that though Jacob curſt the rage of his two ſons, yet he put them not to death for the murder of the Sichemites.</p>

                  <hi>A law must be founded in vnrighteouſnes, if the people doe not puniſh their Rulers, as the Rulers them.</hi> And ſuch a law is contrary to thoſe Rules of righteouſnes God hath preſcribed, and is the deſtruction of mankinde, not any law at tall, and this man feares not to charge God with vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, that forbidds evill ſpeakinge of their Rulers though wicked, and vnjuſt, and ſcoffes at his ordinance calling <hi>anointinge a Charme.</hi> Can any man of Common reaſon imagine, that a people wilbe obedient vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any, whome they have power to punish, or that ſubjection can conſiſt with ſuch a condition?</p>

                  <hi>David, as a private man, and in his owne cauſe feared to lift vp his hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lords anointed, but this Cannot forbidd the law, nor diſarme Iuſtice from havinge legall power againſt any King.</hi> This ſheweth, that divine law forbadd all men to take the Armes of juſtice without, or againſt the King, who is referred to Gods juſtice, and juſtice hath noe Armes, but his power. What David feared, he judged all others had cauſe to feare, <hi>who can touch the Lords anointed, and be innocent?</hi> If David were a private man, being anointed King; who was a publique man? But what David feared, theſe wretches deſpiſe, and Count this forbearance of David a ceremony, which he might have forborne. If David feared in his owne cauſe to lift vp his hand againſt the Lords anointed, the Libeller is his owne judge, and muſt be his tormenter, that makes an impious defence of thoſe, that lifted vp their hand againſt the Lords anointed in their owne cauſe, and were by his owne confeſſion but private men, and he would have their exorbitance, and diſobedience to law vnblameable.

               <p>He hath done with Scripture, he deſcends now to ſaint Ambroſe excommunicatinge Theodoſius, &amp; he will allow the Biſhopp to be a ſaint for this fact, though his calling were Prelaticall, and vnlawfull in his judgment. But what is ſpirituall excommunication to the puttinge of a King to death? This fact of ſaint Ambroſe is noe Rule. Though Chriſtian Biſhopps refuſed to give the holy miſteries to Princes in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of fins, they did not preſume to make a Civill ſeperation betweene them, and their people, and will the Libeller allow the Biſhopps to be more publique perſons, then Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and to doe what they would not? He, that makes ſuch out cryes againſt Popery heere takes vp the moſt ſcandalous doctrine, that any of them maintaine, and which the moſt ſober diſclaime, and takes vp thoſe Arguments, which the Jeſuites vſe for the Clergies, and Popes power over Princes, &amp; yet the man would be accounted a zealous Proteſtant. The examples of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication by the brittish Biſhopps, ſaint Germaine Oudeceus, &amp; the clergy of Morcant might be al true, but nothing to the purpoſe, nor are their excommunications Rules for Chriſtian practice, neither can there be any inference of depoſing, or murderinge Kings from ſuch Actions.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:95058:140"/>
               <p>But for the <hi>greater Credit</hi> he ſayes <hi>the facts of theis Brittiſh Biſhopps were before we had Communion with the Church of Rome.</hi> And may not he looke on himſelfe, and his crew with horrour for vilyfying, and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the calling of Biſhopps, as Papell, and Antichriſtian, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it to be before we had any Communion with the Church of Rome?</p>

                  <hi>What power of depoſinge Kings, and conſequently of putting them to death was aſſumed, and practiſed by the Canon law, he ſayes, he omitts, as a thing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally knowne.</hi> Why would he not tell, by whome it was practiſed, would that diſcredit the Authoritie? What power the Popes practiſed in depoſinge Kings is generally knowne, and deteſted by all good men being Actions contrary to all lawes, but of their owne making. But did the people of England expect, that all the promiſes of Reformation made by the late Parliament would end only in approvinge the Tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and vſurpation of the Pope over Kings, and juſtifying of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der plot, and are all the complaints of the Proteſtant Divines againſt the practice of the Popes become impertinent Clamours? But ſuch a defence is ſuteable to the cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whole Councells have decreed, that a Counſell is above the Pope, though by them not denyed the vicar of Chriſt, and wee may be aſhamed in our cleerer light not to deſcerne further, that a Parliament is above a King.</hi> It were a ſhame to vs, if we ſhould not deſcerne the difference betweene the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent power of Kings, and the vſurped power of the Pope, and this brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker wants ſhame, that pretends cleerer light, and oppoſition to Rome, and yet begg Examples from it. Such, as preferred the authoritie of Counſells above the Pope, had their warrant from the ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, which knew not the vicarſhipp of the Pope different from his brethren; And had theſe Counſells thought him Chriſts vicar, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, as the Romaniſts now maintaine, their concluſion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells ſuperioritie could not conſiſt with their premiſſes; being much alike this Authors ordinary Arguments. But what reſemblance has a Counſell of the whole Church to the Parliament, or Counſell of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kingdome? By the lawes of ſome kingdomes there are noe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments at all, and in Counſells they are not ſubjects, but brethren to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>He comes now to humane lawes, and by them he will prove a divine truth. The <hi>judgment given againſt Oreſtes,</hi> either at Athens, whoſe king he was not, or in any other Countrey, where he was but a <hi>Titular,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves nothing, though he ſtory were Authenticke, and the proceedings legall, but popular furies, though occaſioned by their Governours Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are not Examples of imitation. <hi>Solons lawes</hi> belonged not to king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>
                  <hi>The Decree in Rome</hi> is farr wide from the matter, and what the <hi>Senate</hi> did againſt <hi>Nero,</hi> was in vindication of their ancient power, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the Juſtice of his ſoveraigntie. Though Theodoſius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the law to be above the Emperour, yet he decreed not any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have power over the Emperour. The law was above him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard it was his Rule, but could not make any perſon, or ſocietie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him. The law is the directive power to Kings, but ſubject them not to any, and it is a ſenſeles deduction from the ſuperioritie of the Rule to imagine an inferioritie of the Rulers to the people, or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie in power by the Rule.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Bracton,</hi> or <hi>Cleta</hi> ſay <hi>the King is inferiour to the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is a manifeſt vntruth, and Bracton ſayes expreſſely, the King hath not a ſuperiour on earth to puniſh him, and that only God is the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Actions, ſoe farr were theis men from affirminge, that <hi>he ſtands as liable to receive Iuſtice, as the meaneſt of his ſubjects.</hi> But this man thinkes, that ſome of his Readers will beleive, that the name of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is ſufficient Authoritie, though the ſpeake contrary to what he alleadges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is ſaid in an ancient booke, the King ought to be ſubject to the law by his oath.</hi> Though the King be bound to performe the law by his oath, is there any to judge him, when all are his ſubjects, and derive their power from him, or is he ſubject to any perſon? And who can judge another, that is not ſubject to him? Becauſe Kings bound themſelves to doe Juſtice, therefore did they give other men power over them?</p>
               <p>That the king permitted queſtions of his right to <hi>ordinary Iudicature</hi> is an vſe of Counſell, not ſubjection, all Courts being his Counſells, for deciſion of controverſies, but its a ſorry inference, that Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in his affaires ſhould have power over his perſon. As the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments right is circumſcribed by lawes in regarde of the ſubject, ſoe it cannot be imagined abſolute over the King. By what the Libeller hath ſaid, he might well conclude, that kings are oblidged to doe juſtice, but that the people, or particular perſons may judge their king by any law divine, or humane, he hath not offred a colour, ſoe barren is he in an Argument, which he calls <hi>over copious.</hi>

               <p>The Libeller aſkes, <hi>who have more right to take knowledge of things done within a free nation, then they within themſelves.</hi> And ſurely they will not be free long from deſtroying one another, where thats the libertie, for there wilbe as many Tranſgreſſours, and as many lawes, as there are opinions.</p>
               <p>He goes about to anſweare the taking the oath of <hi>Alleagiance, and ſupreamacy.</hi> And to this his anſweare is very ready, that <hi>theſe oaths were to his perſon inveſted with his Authoritie, and his Authoritie was by the people given him conditionally vnder law, and oath.</hi> And if his Authoritie had been conditionall, their oaths could not be abſolute, as they are. This guift, and condition they imagine were engraven in Seths Pillars, and they have been long enquiringe for a Cabballiſticke Rabbyn to finde out the Characters. How the kings hereditary ſucceſſion is become a conditionall guift, muſt have better evidence then Aphoriſmes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, never law contained either the guift, or condition, nor was there ever ſuch impudence before theis Traytours, that avowed, becauſe they ſwore faith to their kings perſon inveſted with his Authoritie, they might take away his Authoritie, and not breake their oath, And it were a prophane oath, aſwell, as vaine, that ſhould be voyde at the will of the taker. The kings oath added nothing to his right, being only an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of his conſcience, noe condition annexed to his right, and if he never tooke the oath, his ſubjects obedience is noe whit diminiſhed, and a king by inheritance needes not <hi>admittance,</hi> the death of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſour puts him in poſſeſſion, &amp; this is the knowne law of England. <hi>The Couquerour</hi> tooke on oath at his Crowninge, and other times, that made noe condition to his Government. There is not only reaſon, but abſolute neceſſitie for the avoyding of confuſion, &amp; ruine of mankinde, that the ſubject be bound to the king, though the kinge faile in his dutie, for the deſtruction of Government is more ſinfull, and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to humane societie, then any evill, that can come by a kings miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government.</p>

They were <hi>accuſed by the King, and his partie to pretend libertie, and reformation, but to have noe other end, then to make themſelves greate, and to deſtroy his perſon, and Authoritie, for which reaſon</hi> ſayes the Libeller, <hi>they added the third Article to preſerve the Kings perſon, and Authoritie in defence of Religion, priviledge of Parliament, and liberties of the Kingdome.</hi> And to ſhew with what ingenuitie he dealt, in ſeeking to avoyde that juſt accuſation, the Libeller tells vs, that they added that cauſe for a ſhew only, and they intended not to preſerve the Kings perſon further, then it might conſiſt with their opinions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge Reformation, extirpatinge of Prelacy, preſervinge liberties of Parliament, and Kingdome, and in this very clauſe they called <hi>the world

                  <hi>Thoſe Kings are counted noe better, then his ten hornes.</hi> Noe better, but by what proofe, are they the ſame by ſuch frenetique dreames, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces? <hi>They ſhall hate the whore,</hi> and yet <hi>the ſaints muſt deſtroy them,</hi> and <hi>ſhall burne her with fire,</hi> and yet <hi>be overcome firſt themſelves. But they ſhall at laſt joyne their Armyes with the Beaſt after they have deſtroyed the whore.</hi> And this is the Babiloniſh Creede, a bundle of contradictions to carry their Giddy followers into attempts as wicked, as their conceites are irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall. We ſee the grounds of their cauſe, an helliſh impulſion againſt Government, and hatred of Kings, there having not been impoſters of equall impudence ſince Mahomett, that profeſſe a Religion to deſtroy all Kings, and thoſe Blaſphemies, that were abhorred in former Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Entheuſiaſts are the Creed of thoſe miſcreants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tis true, there be a ſort of moody, hott brain'd, and allwayes vnedified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences apt to engage their leaders paſt retirement, and then vpon a ſudden qualme, and Swimminge of their conſcience to betray them baſely in the middeſt of what was cheifely vndertaken for their ſakes.</hi> Seducers cannot thinke to be vndiſcovered forever, but ſuch, as are not reſolute villaines have a moody conſcience in this mans judgment, the tender conſcience is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moody, and hott brain'd, and certenly ſuch were many in this Rebellion, or it could never have proceeded ſoe farr. <hi>Let ſuch men never meete with any faithfull Parliament to hazard for them.</hi> And let never Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament thinke to be better rewarded, that follow a faction to betray their King, then to be ſubject to thoſe baſe multitudes, whome they ſuborned to attempts againſt their loyaltie, and become ſlaves.</p>
               <p>He findes <hi>others, in whoſe conſciences gaine hath ſprung a ſudden leake, and theſe are they that cry out of the Covenant broken.</hi> Thus the builders of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell are ſcattered, while they make conſcience, and Religion their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, and in the meane time, nothing is more the ſubject of their ſcorne. And if <hi>God were mocked in pretending the Covenant in Scotland, and Vlſter,</hi> he was much more in England by crying out the King, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lawes, and libertie, and the Libeller might have found ſuch men, whoſe proſperitie was ſinne, that Triumpht in the afflictions of him, whome they perſecuted, and ſaid tuſh God hath forſaken him, let vs ſmite him, that he riſe noe more. The <hi>ſinne of Ahas,</hi> that tranſgreſſed more in the tyme of his affliction hath noe reſemblance to a vertuous Prince afflicted by Traytours, whoſe crueltie encreaſed, while they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed him, and exceeded the inhumanitie of the curſed Moabites, that burnt the bones of the King of Edom into lime.</p>
               <p>The Kings Charatie in <hi>forgivinge his Enemies,</hi> will finde a right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction with all true Chriſtians, but malice, and detraction of all Acts of pittie cannot meete, with leſſe, then deteſtation in all men any way quallified with Religion, or reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hipocrites Almes,</hi> are not more odious, then hipocrites cenſures, the crueltie of Hipocrites will receive a greater condemnation, then their Almes.</p>

                  <hi>Prayers for Gods Compaſſion,</hi> are not to <hi>ſhare victory with Gods Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> But ſuch, as ſtrive to ſlander mens prayers to God are as malicious to Gods victory, as the devotions of thoſe, that pray vnto him. Such as reade this impudent Libell may rightly call it the Rebells Image, conteyninge precepts, and poſitions of violence againſt Government, confuſion of States, doctrines of falſhood, and hipocriſie, prayſes of inſolence, and crueltie, prophaninge of Gods name, and word, ſcoffes at things ſacred, diſſolution of all bonds morall, Civill, and Religious, of all orders, and degrees among men. And it muſt be hatred to God, and a Diabolicall impulſion, that drives on ſuch perſons to fill vp the meaſure of their wickednes.</p>
